303_utt_DAIC_1 how are you doing today
303_utt_DAIC_2 okay how 'bout yourself
303_utt_DAIC_3 i'm great thanks
303_utt_DAIC_4 where are you from originally
303_utt_DAIC_5 here in california
303_utt_DAIC_6 really
303_utt_DAIC_7 yeah
303_utt_DAIC_8 what are some things you really like about l_a 
303_utt_DAIC_9 oh well that it's big and broad there's a lot to do a lot of um
303_utt_DAIC_10 um job opportunities than other states
303_utt_DAIC_11 um pretty much that it's big and there's a lot you can do here
303_utt_DAIC_12 yeah
303_utt_DAIC_13 what are some things you don't really like about l_a
303_utt_DAIC_14 traffic um maybe the violence rate bad news even though you know you wanna know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis
303_utt_DAIC_15 mhm
303_utt_DAIC_16 what'd you study at school
303_utt_DAIC_17 sociology i have a um two year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology
303_utt_DAIC_18 nice
303_utt_DAIC_19 are you still working in that
303_utt_DAIC_20 no i'm actually an m_t_a bus operator
303_utt_DAIC_21 what's your dream job
303_utt_DAIC_22 well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um 'cause they look to promote within the company so that's the good thing there's a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition and things of that nature
303_utt_DAIC_23 mhm
303_utt_DAIC_24 that sounds like a great situation 
303_utt_DAIC_25 thanks
303_utt_DAIC_26 how hard is that
303_utt_DAIC_27 well it's not actually hard as right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now 'cause they look to promote within so you know so since i'm already working there that's a good thing so it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible 
303_utt_DAIC_28 that makes sense 
303_utt_DAIC_29 do you consider yourself an introvert
303_utt_DAIC_30 what do you mean i'm sorry
303_utt_DAIC_31 let's come back to that later
303_utt_DAIC_32 okay
303_utt_DAIC_33 what do you do to relax
303_utt_DAIC_34 read take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes
303_utt_DAIC_35 okay
303_utt_DAIC_36 how are you at controlling your temper 
303_utt_DAIC_37 i'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you gotta remain calm and still remain professional at the same time
303_utt_DAIC_38 right
303_utt_DAIC_39 how hard is that
303_utt_DAIC_40 well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated
303_utt_DAIC_41 has that gotten you in trouble
303_utt_DAIC_42 no i'm pretty good at it now
303_utt_DAIC_43 maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today
303_utt_DAIC_44 that's good
303_utt_DAIC_45 yeah
303_utt_DAIC_46 who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
303_utt_DAIC_47 i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just go that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but
303_utt_DAIC_48 my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family  
303_utt_DAIC_49 that sounds like a great situation
303_utt_DAIC_50 thank you
303_utt_DAIC_51 do you find it easy to be a parent
303_utt_DAIC_52 no <laughter>
303_utt_DAIC_53 what's the hardest thing about being a parent
303_utt_DAIC_54 um setting good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home
303_utt_DAIC_55 mhm
303_utt_DAIC_56 can you give me an example of that
303_utt_DAIC_57 well um
303_utt_DAIC_58 by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature
303_utt_DAIC_59 mhm 
303_utt_DAIC_60 tell me about your kids
303_utt_DAIC_61 i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old
303_utt_DAIC_62 aw
303_utt_DAIC_63 yeah i'm 'bout to be
303_utt_DAIC_64 well my daughter's pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time
303_utt_DAIC_65 wow
303_utt_DAIC_66 awesome 
303_utt_DAIC_67 yeah thank you
303_utt_DAIC_68 what's the hardest thing about being a parent
303_utt_DAIC_69 the hardest thing is
303_utt_DAIC_70 well right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and
303_utt_DAIC_71 yeah
303_utt_DAIC_72 they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can
303_utt_DAIC_73 yeah i see what you mean
303_utt_DAIC_74 what's one of your most memorable experiences 
303_utt_DAIC_75 with my kids or just period
303_utt_DAIC_76 whatever comes to your mind
303_utt_DAIC_77 what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know
303_utt_DAIC_78 wow
303_utt_DAIC_79 and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know
303_utt_DAIC_80 you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me 
303_utt_DAIC_81 that's so good to hear
303_utt_DAIC_82 thank you
303_utt_DAIC_83 how did you feel in that moment 
303_utt_DAIC_84 happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so
303_utt_DAIC_85 i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week
303_utt_DAIC_86 yeah
303_utt_DAIC_87 that sounds like a great situation 
303_utt_DAIC_88 thank you
303_utt_DAIC_89 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
303_utt_DAIC_90 hm
303_utt_DAIC_91 well the advice i would've gave myself
303_utt_DAIC_92 that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that
303_utt_DAIC_93 i probably would've
303_utt_DAIC_94 stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um
303_utt_DAIC_95 rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um
303_utt_DAIC_96 education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day
303_utt_DAIC_97 so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career
303_utt_DAIC_98 right
303_utt_DAIC_99 yeah
303_utt_DAIC_100 could you have done anything to avoid it
303_utt_DAIC_101 i'm not quite sure um
303_utt_DAIC_102 you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so 
303_utt_DAIC_103 yeah there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there 
303_utt_DAIC_104 yes
303_utt_DAIC_105 when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
303_utt_DAIC_106 my oldest daughter
303_utt_DAIC_107 we had a argument because
303_utt_DAIC_108 just
303_utt_DAIC_109 the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through
303_utt_DAIC_110 and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation
303_utt_DAIC_111 and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know
303_utt_DAIC_112 hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or 
303_utt_DAIC_113 or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but
303_utt_DAIC_114 right
303_utt_DAIC_115 that just happened you know
303_utt_DAIC_116 i just told her i'm not
303_utt_DAIC_117 how close are you to them
303_utt_DAIC_118 i'm sorry
303_utt_DAIC_119 how close are you to them
303_utt_DAIC_120 very close
303_utt_DAIC_121 very close it's just that the the situation my daughter's in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life
303_utt_DAIC_122 and I'll be telling
303_utt_DAIC_123 tell me more about that
303_utt_DAIC_124 she's um
303_utt_DAIC_125 she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite
303_utt_DAIC_126 mhm
303_utt_DAIC_127 and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change
303_utt_DAIC_128 yeah
303_utt_DAIC_129 how hard is that
303_utt_DAIC_130 it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but
303_utt_DAIC_131 yeah
303_utt_DAIC_132 yeah

303_utt_DAIC_140 since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kinda like
303_utt_DAIC_141 <clears throat> it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person you'll be that day you know 'cause everybody have they days whether they're good or bad but that's just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good night's good good night's rest hopefully you'll have a good day you know
303_utt_DAIC_142 mhm

304_utt_DAIC_62 yeah <laughter>
304_utt_DAIC_63 what are some things that make you really mad 
304_utt_DAIC_64 there's nothing that really gets me really mad that i can think of the top of my head
304_utt_DAIC_65 um
304_utt_DAIC_66 whatever comes to your mind
304_utt_DAIC_67 um
304_utt_DAIC_68 maybe when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe 
304_utt_DAIC_69 mhm
304_utt_DAIC_70 that really gets me mad
304_utt_DAIC_71 okay
304_utt_DAIC_72 do you consider yourself an introvert
304_utt_DAIC_73 mm yes 
304_utt_DAIC_74 why
304_utt_DAIC_75 because i do things from within i guess so um internally motivated to do things i guess yeah
304_utt_DAIC_76 do you feel that way often
304_utt_DAIC_77 yeah
304_utt_DAIC_78 okay
304_utt_DAIC_79 when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about 
304_utt_DAIC_80 wow
304_utt_DAIC_81 i hardly ever argue with somebody <laughter>
304_utt_DAIC_82 really
304_utt_DAIC_83 yeah
304_utt_DAIC_84 oh my sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago
304_utt_DAIC_85 <laughter>
304_utt_DAIC_86 how did you feel in that moment
304_utt_DAIC_87 uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all
304_utt_DAIC_88 mhm
304_utt_DAIC_89 can you tell me about that
304_utt_DAIC_90 um
304_utt_DAIC_91 just her getting into grown folks' business and
304_utt_DAIC_92 it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said
304_utt_DAIC_93 and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter> 
304_utt_DAIC_94 oh my gosh
304_utt_DAIC_95 and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people
304_utt_DAIC_96 that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that
304_utt_DAIC_97 yeah that sucks
304_utt_DAIC_98 yeah so but i mean we're fine now
304_utt_DAIC_99 so that's good
304_utt_DAIC_100 that's so good to hear
304_utt_DAIC_101 yeah
304_utt_DAIC_102 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
304_utt_DAIC_103 to not 
304_utt_DAIC_104 believe people so easily
304_utt_DAIC_105 so gullible to not be so gullible
304_utt_DAIC_106 hm
304_utt_DAIC_107 okay
304_utt_DAIC_108 tell me more about that
304_utt_DAIC_109 i guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i don't wanna say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um
304_utt_DAIC_110 yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances

305_utt_DAIC_41 uh that kinda
305_utt_DAIC_42 threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off
305_utt_DAIC_43 and uh I couldn't um
305_utt_DAIC_44 i haven't really uh
305_utt_DAIC_45 found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking
305_utt_DAIC_46 and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh
305_utt_DAIC_47 so

305_utt_DAIC_112 pardon me
305_utt_DAIC_113 when was the last time that happened 
305_utt_DAIC_114 uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh
305_utt_DAIC_115 you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh
305_utt_DAIC_116 people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes
305_utt_DAIC_117 mm
305_utt_DAIC_118 you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that
305_utt_DAIC_119 yeah
305_utt_DAIC_120 that sucks
305_utt_DAIC_121 yeah big time
305_utt_DAIC_122 what do you do when you're annoyed
305_utt_DAIC_123 what do i do when i'm annoyed
305_utt_DAIC_124 mhm
305_utt_DAIC_125 um
305_utt_DAIC_126 probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um
305_utt_DAIC_127 well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis  
305_utt_DAIC_128 and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek
305_utt_DAIC_129 wow
305_utt_DAIC_130 yeah
305_utt_DAIC_131 how hard is that
305_utt_DAIC_132 uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions
305_utt_DAIC_133 yeah
305_utt_DAIC_134 when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
305_utt_DAIC_135 um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh 
305_utt_DAIC_136 um i'm pretty honest with
305_utt_DAIC_137 i'm open and honest about any anything and everything
305_utt_DAIC_138 mhm
305_utt_DAIC_139 and uh
305_utt_DAIC_140 what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just
305_utt_DAIC_141 you know didn't like that at all
305_utt_DAIC_142 yeah
305_utt_DAIC_143 how did you feel in that moment
305_utt_DAIC_144 pardon me
305_utt_DAIC_145 how did you feel in that moment
305_utt_DAIC_146 um
305_utt_DAIC_147 i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh
305_utt_DAIC_148 just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh
305_utt_DAIC_149 i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest 
305_utt_DAIC_150 um
305_utt_DAIC_151 i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so
305_utt_DAIC_152 mhm
305_utt_DAIC_153 you know and if you're lying about something well
305_utt_DAIC_154 you just you're always having to cover up uh
305_utt_DAIC_155 more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just
305_utt_DAIC_156 don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship

305_utt_DAIC_208 i see what you mean
305_utt_DAIC_209 how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
305_utt_DAIC_210 um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh
305_utt_DAIC_211 going on a year um
305_utt_DAIC_212 you know i uh
305_utt_DAIC_213 depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um
305_utt_DAIC_214 so just
305_utt_DAIC_215 wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts 
305_utt_DAIC_216 so 
305_utt_DAIC_217 or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over
305_utt_DAIC_218 so
305_utt_DAIC_219 yeah
305_utt_DAIC_220 i don't
305_utt_DAIC_221 lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired
305_utt_DAIC_222 mhm
305_utt_DAIC_223 do you feel that way often
305_utt_DAIC_224 uh lately i have been probably about the last few months
305_utt_DAIC_225 what are you like when you don't sleep well

305_utt_DAIC_227 tired <laughter>
305_utt_DAIC_228 um i you know
305_utt_DAIC_229 if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work
305_utt_DAIC_230 um
305_utt_DAIC_231 and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head
305_utt_DAIC_232 mhm
305_utt_DAIC_233 and so
305_utt_DAIC_234 you know um
305_utt_DAIC_235 i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me
305_utt_DAIC_236 and uh
305_utt_DAIC_237 so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about
305_utt_DAIC_238 you know um money um
305_utt_DAIC_239 you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or
305_utt_DAIC_240 mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that 
305_utt_DAIC_241 mm

305_utt_DAIC_266 on uh how to interview how to uh
305_utt_DAIC_267 how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh
305_utt_DAIC_268 i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who 
305_utt_DAIC_269 who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done 
305_utt_DAIC_270 mhm
305_utt_DAIC_271 uh
305_utt_DAIC_272 i've done uh
305_utt_DAIC_273 i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and 
305_utt_DAIC_274 and try to uh work on
305_utt_DAIC_275 the issues that were bothering me so um
305_utt_DAIC_276 you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school
305_utt_DAIC_277 and uh
305_utt_DAIC_278 anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities 
305_utt_DAIC_279 mhm
305_utt_DAIC_280 that's good
305_utt_DAIC_281 do you feel like therapy is useful
305_utt_DAIC_282 pardon me
305_utt_DAIC_283 do you feel like therapy is useful
305_utt_DAIC_284 i still didn't hear you
305_utt_DAIC_285 do you feel like therapy is useful
305_utt_DAIC_286 that
305_utt_DAIC_287 people have been deceitful
305_utt_DAIC_288 can you repeat that one more time
305_utt_DAIC_289 why don't we talk about that later
305_utt_DAIC_290 alright
305_utt_DAIC_291 have you been diagnosed with depression
305_utt_DAIC_292 uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism
305_utt_DAIC_293 how hard is that
305_utt_DAIC_294 um
305_utt_DAIC_295 it's tough if you don't you know um
305_utt_DAIC_296 i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um
305_utt_DAIC_297 again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know
305_utt_DAIC_298 mhm
305_utt_DAIC_299 um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and 
305_utt_DAIC_300 and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um
305_utt_DAIC_301 you know
305_utt_DAIC_302 some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and
305_utt_DAIC_303 so i just try to cope with things uh
305_utt_DAIC_304 um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years
305_utt_DAIC_305 actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um
305_utt_DAIC_306 whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it  
305_utt_DAIC_307 um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still 
305_utt_DAIC_308 uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just
305_utt_DAIC_309 yeah
305_utt_DAIC_310 and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people
305_utt_DAIC_311 um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so
305_utt_DAIC_312 um
305_utt_DAIC_313 but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um
305_utt_DAIC_314 mm
305_utt_DAIC_315 but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um
305_utt_DAIC_316 you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus
305_utt_DAIC_317 that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way 
305_utt_DAIC_318 yeah
305_utt_DAIC_319 so i just let it go
305_utt_DAIC_320 i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad 
305_utt_DAIC_321 i understand
305_utt_DAIC_322 did you think you had a problem before you found out
305_utt_DAIC_323 did i have a problem before i got out
305_utt_DAIC_324 did you think you had a problem before you found out
305_utt_DAIC_325 uh
305_utt_DAIC_326 well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people 
305_utt_DAIC_327 um
305_utt_DAIC_328 i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um 
305_utt_DAIC_329 a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago 
305_utt_DAIC_330 uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older
305_utt_DAIC_331 kind of uh
305_utt_DAIC_332 you know makes it work you know
305_utt_DAIC_333 yeah
305_utt_DAIC_334 me me dealing with life so
305_utt_DAIC_335 how has seeing a therapist affected you
305_utt_DAIC_336 pardon me
305_utt_DAIC_337 how has seeing a therapist affected you
305_utt_DAIC_338 uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while
305_utt_DAIC_339 uh recently
305_utt_DAIC_340 and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um
305_utt_DAIC_341 a lot of people may not understand that but uh
305_utt_DAIC_342 a therapist is
305_utt_DAIC_343 i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh
305_utt_DAIC_344 people you know uh
305_utt_DAIC_345 uh
305_utt_DAIC_346 other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like
305_utt_DAIC_347 you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others
305_utt_DAIC_348 uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who
305_utt_DAIC_349 will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know
305_utt_DAIC_350 right
305_utt_DAIC_351 but it's good to have
305_utt_DAIC_352 that's so good to hear

310_utt_DAIC_198 general studies i from what i remember i i i i actually didn't finish i quit to uh
310_utt_DAIC_199 uh go
310_utt_DAIC_200 play in a band so i i i skipped a lot of school so i didn't really <laughter> you know
310_utt_DAIC_201 so nothing uh
310_utt_DAIC_202 it was a junior college <coll> or community college so it was i didn't go to university so i was just
310_utt_DAIC_203 what made you decide to do that
310_utt_DAIC_204 do what
310_utt_DAIC_205 stop going
310_utt_DAIC_206 yes
310_utt_DAIC_207 i just wasn't interested <laughter> my interests were elsewhere so i just i just quit going you know so
310_utt_DAIC_208 hmm

310_utt_DAIC_239 <laughter>
312_utt_DAIC_0 hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today
312_utt_DAIC_1 i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment
312_utt_DAIC_2 i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started
312_utt_DAIC_3 and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential 
312_utt_DAIC_4 are you okay with this
312_utt_DAIC_5 yes
312_utt_DAIC_6 okay
312_utt_DAIC_7 so how are you doing today
312_utt_DAIC_8 fine how about you
312_utt_DAIC_9 i'm great thanks
312_utt_DAIC_10 where are you from originally
312_utt_DAIC_11 here
312_utt_DAIC_12 really
312_utt_DAIC_13 yes
312_utt_DAIC_14 what are some things you really like about l_a
312_utt_DAIC_15 the weather
312_utt_DAIC_16 weather mainly
312_utt_DAIC_17 yeah the main <ma> the weather
312_utt_DAIC_18 sorry
312_utt_DAIC_19 what are some things you don't really like about l_a
312_utt_DAIC_20 not the people well some of the people stuff like that some people
312_utt_DAIC_21 <laughter>
312_utt_DAIC_22 okay i'm cutting you off
312_utt_DAIC_23 do you travel a lot
312_utt_DAIC_24 not as much as i used to
312_utt_DAIC_25 why
312_utt_DAIC_26 um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but i'm not in school right now but later on i'll get back into school and i'll travel more but right no doubt
312_utt_DAIC_27 what do you enjoy about traveling
312_utt_DAIC_28 i don't
312_utt_DAIC_29 i don't enjoy traveling
312_utt_DAIC_30 what'd you study at school
312_utt_DAIC_31 uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly
312_utt_DAIC_32 are you still working in that
312_utt_DAIC_33 yes i am actually
312_utt_DAIC_34 what do you do now
312_utt_DAIC_35 right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire
312_utt_DAIC_36 awesome
312_utt_DAIC_37 impressive
312_utt_DAIC_38 what's your dream job
312_utt_DAIC_39 professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that
312_utt_DAIC_40 where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest
312_utt_DAIC_41 <laughter>
312_utt_DAIC_42 you're actually pretty good at this
312_utt_DAIC_43 who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
312_utt_DAIC_44 <sigh> i there's a lot of people
312_utt_DAIC_45 the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know
312_utt_DAIC_46 he's the first one who taught me that
312_utt_DAIC_47 school was not about a grade but about learning
312_utt_DAIC_48 mhm
312_utt_DAIC_49 that's so good to hear
312_utt_DAIC_50 okay
312_utt_DAIC_51 how are you at controlling your temper
312_utt_DAIC_52 i'm pretty good i think
312_utt_DAIC_53 when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
312_utt_DAIC_54 i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about
312_utt_DAIC_55 he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good
312_utt_DAIC_56 um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all
312_utt_DAIC_57 okay
312_utt_DAIC_58 how close are you to your family
312_utt_DAIC_59 fairly close um
312_utt_DAIC_60 i see them pretty 
312_utt_DAIC_61 pretty often parents i see a couple times a week
312_utt_DAIC_62 they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that
312_utt_DAIC_63 and my brother i see 
312_utt_DAIC_64 same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also
312_utt_DAIC_65 aw
312_utt_DAIC_66 that's good
312_utt_DAIC_67 interesting
312_utt_DAIC_68 do you consider yourself an introvert
312_utt_DAIC_69 yes
312_utt_DAIC_70 why
312_utt_DAIC_71 because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading
312_utt_DAIC_72 and not talking to anybody that's introverted
312_utt_DAIC_73 i see what you mean
312_utt_DAIC_74 what do you do to relax
312_utt_DAIC_75 i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot
312_utt_DAIC_76 i try to at least
312_utt_DAIC_77 cool
312_utt_DAIC_78 what do you do when you're annoyed
312_utt_DAIC_79 i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing
312_utt_DAIC_80 um
312_utt_DAIC_81 and that's about it i think
312_utt_DAIC_82 okay
312_utt_DAIC_83 what do you think of today's kids
312_utt_DAIC_84 <deep breath>
312_utt_DAIC_85 bad parenting
312_utt_DAIC_86 basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just 
312_utt_DAIC_87 do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion
312_utt_DAIC_88 mm
312_utt_DAIC_89 that makes sense
312_utt_DAIC_90 what's one of your most memorable experiences 
312_utt_DAIC_91 <sigh>
312_utt_DAIC_92 um
312_utt_DAIC_93 i guess
312_utt_DAIC_94 scrubbed_entry
312_utt_DAIC_95 um
312_utt_DAIC_96 scrubbed_entry
312_utt_DAIC_97 scrubbed_entry
312_utt_DAIC_98 awesome
312_utt_DAIC_99 thank you
312_utt_DAIC_100 how would your best friend describe you
312_utt_DAIC_101 i don't really have a best friend
312_utt_DAIC_102 introverted remember
312_utt_DAIC_103 okay
312_utt_DAIC_104 what would you say are some of your best qualities
312_utt_DAIC_105 i'm biased obviously
312_utt_DAIC_106 but they are
312_utt_DAIC_107 i'm really good in math
312_utt_DAIC_108 i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is
312_utt_DAIC_109 it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think
312_utt_DAIC_110 and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway
312_utt_DAIC_111 that type of thing
312_utt_DAIC_112 what are some things that usually put you in a good mood
312_utt_DAIC_113 when i a good workout 
312_utt_DAIC_114 doing well in video games small little things like that
312_utt_DAIC_115 um
312_utt_DAIC_116 what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood
312_utt_DAIC_117 nice
312_utt_DAIC_118 thank you
312_utt_DAIC_119 what are you most proud of in your life
312_utt_DAIC_120 right now
312_utt_DAIC_121 it's the fact that
312_utt_DAIC_122 research that i did i did make it this far
312_utt_DAIC_123 research wise that's all
312_utt_DAIC_124 that's all
312_utt_DAIC_125 tell me more about that
312_utt_DAIC_126 interesting um
312_utt_DAIC_127 when you start off in school
312_utt_DAIC_128 you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics
312_utt_DAIC_129 and
312_utt_DAIC_130 you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it
312_utt_DAIC_131 and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you
312_utt_DAIC_132 as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid
312_utt_DAIC_133 yeah
312_utt_DAIC_134 okay
312_utt_DAIC_135 when was the last time you felt really happy
312_utt_DAIC_136 um
312_utt_DAIC_137 a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class
312_utt_DAIC_138 cool
312_utt_DAIC_139 thank you
312_utt_DAIC_140 have you ever served in the military
312_utt_DAIC_141 yes briefly 
312_utt_DAIC_142 many years ago <ag> yes
312_utt_DAIC_143 really
312_utt_DAIC_144 why'd you decide to enlist in the military
312_utt_DAIC_145 i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that 
312_utt_DAIC_146 how old were you when you joined the military
312_utt_DAIC_147 um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen
312_utt_DAIC_148 i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two
312_utt_DAIC_149 you were very young weren't you 
312_utt_DAIC_150 yes
312_utt_DAIC_151 not really
312_utt_DAIC_152 how did serving in the military change you
312_utt_DAIC_153 i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much
312_utt_DAIC_154 mm
312_utt_DAIC_155 what did you do after the military
312_utt_DAIC_156 graduate school
312_utt_DAIC_157 in physics
312_utt_DAIC_158 okay
312_utt_DAIC_159 have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
312_utt_DAIC_160 no
312_utt_DAIC_161 have you been diagnosed with depression
312_utt_DAIC_162 nope
312_utt_DAIC_163 how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
312_utt_DAIC_164 it depends if i workout really hard the night before <bef> the day the day before
312_utt_DAIC_165 if workout pretty hard it's bad but if i don't workout it i don't know just eh it's hard
312_utt_DAIC_166 i guess moderately 
312_utt_DAIC_167 that makes sense
312_utt_DAIC_168 thank you
312_utt_DAIC_169 do you feel that way often
312_utt_DAIC_170 yes
312_utt_DAIC_171 i'm sorry
312_utt_DAIC_172 it's okay
312_utt_DAIC_173 what are you like when you don't sleep well
312_utt_DAIC_174 i'm probably like i am now
312_utt_DAIC_175 normal i think not as not as happy about everything  but still pretty okay i can still function
312_utt_DAIC_176 uh huh
312_utt_DAIC_177 have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately 
312_utt_DAIC_178 no

312_utt_DAIC_186 tell me more about that
312_utt_DAIC_187 um applying to grad school again it's been awhile and slightly apprehensive happy that it's looks good but apprehensive that it might not be good and things like that
312_utt_DAIC_188 how hard is that
312_utt_DAIC_189 what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school
312_utt_DAIC_190 yes
312_utt_DAIC_191 i understand
312_utt_DAIC_192 why don't we talk about that later
312_utt_DAIC_193 okay
312_utt_DAIC_194 i agree
312_utt_DAIC_195 okay
312_utt_DAIC_196 is there anything you regret
312_utt_DAIC_197 no not really
312_utt_DAIC_198 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
312_utt_DAIC_199 probably keep doing what you're doing even though i'm not that old believe it or not um
312_utt_DAIC_200 twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen
312_utt_DAIC_201 um just keep doing what you're doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i don't think it'd worked out so well

313_utt_DAIC_28 i wish the seasons were more distinct
313_utt_DAIC_29 and that everything costs a lot of money here
313_utt_DAIC_30 i see what you mean
313_utt_DAIC_31 how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a

313_utt_DAIC_42 <cough>
313_utt_DAIC_43 what do you do when you're annoyed
313_utt_DAIC_44 i guess it depends on 
313_utt_DAIC_45 what i'm annoyed about like if it's at another person or about something i did or just life in general
313_utt_DAIC_46 mhm
313_utt_DAIC_47 can you give me an example of that
313_utt_DAIC_48 uh
313_utt_DAIC_49 if somebody like a person annoys me i'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop
313_utt_DAIC_50 uh huh
313_utt_DAIC_51 is that what you're talking about
313_utt_DAIC_52 okay
313_utt_DAIC_53 yes

313_utt_DAIC_55 how are you at controlling your temper
313_utt_DAIC_56 uh so so not not as good as i'd like to be
313_utt_DAIC_57 when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
313_utt_DAIC_58 uh
313_utt_DAIC_59 a few days ago about getting paid for something i did on time
313_utt_DAIC_60 how did you feel in that moment
313_utt_DAIC_61 uh pretty pissed off
313_utt_DAIC_62 taken advantage of
313_utt_DAIC_63 yeah
313_utt_DAIC_64 what are some things you like to do for fun

313_utt_DAIC_68 that sort of thing
313_utt_DAIC_69 cool
313_utt_DAIC_70 do you consider yourself an introvert
313_utt_DAIC_71 mm at times
313_utt_DAIC_72 why
313_utt_DAIC_73 uh because
313_utt_DAIC_74 sometimes i like to keep to myself and don't feel like showing a lot of outward emotion
313_utt_DAIC_75 okay
313_utt_DAIC_76 what'd you study at school
313_utt_DAIC_77 i have a degree in in liberal arts majored in political science

325_utt_DAIC_61 getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um
325_utt_DAIC_62 we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight
325_utt_DAIC_63 aww
325_utt_DAIC_64 that's good
325_utt_DAIC_65 what do you do to relax
325_utt_DAIC_66 um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people 
325_utt_DAIC_67 okay
325_utt_DAIC_68 how close are you to your family
325_utt_DAIC_69 i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh
325_utt_DAIC_70 couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground
325_utt_DAIC_71 i see what you mean
325_utt_DAIC_72 do you consider yourself an introvert
325_utt_DAIC_73 yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i
325_utt_DAIC_74 seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge 
325_utt_DAIC_75 mhm
325_utt_DAIC_76 how would your best friend describe you
325_utt_DAIC_77 i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend
325_utt_DAIC_78 um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal  
325_utt_DAIC_79 that's great
325_utt_DAIC_80 what are you most proud of in your life
325_utt_DAIC_81 i think i'm just proud of who i am xxx i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm
325_utt_DAIC_82 i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself 
325_utt_DAIC_83 a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that
325_utt_DAIC_84 that's so good to hear
325_utt_DAIC_85 <laughter>
325_utt_DAIC_86 have you ever served in the military
325_utt_DAIC_87 no i have not
325_utt_DAIC_88 have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
325_utt_DAIC_89 no
325_utt_DAIC_90 have you been diagnosed with depression
325_utt_DAIC_91 yes
325_utt_DAIC_92 how long ago were you diagnosed
325_utt_DAIC_93 i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago 
325_utt_DAIC_94 you were very young weren't you
325_utt_DAIC_95 yes
325_utt_DAIC_96 what got you to seek help
325_utt_DAIC_97 um i was cutting and my
325_utt_DAIC_98 one of my best friends called
325_utt_DAIC_99 um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um
325_utt_DAIC_100 it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help
325_utt_DAIC_101 do you still go to therapy now
325_utt_DAIC_102 i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks 
325_utt_DAIC_103 that sucks
325_utt_DAIC_104 <laughter>
325_utt_DAIC_105 do you feel like therapy's useful
325_utt_DAIC_106 uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back
325_utt_DAIC_107 yeah
325_utt_DAIC_108 how have you been feeling lately
325_utt_DAIC_109 lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and
325_utt_DAIC_110 my routine of go to school
325_utt_DAIC_111 and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit 
325_utt_DAIC_112 weird finding out what to do with my
325_utt_DAIC_113 finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um
325_utt_DAIC_114 depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california 
325_utt_DAIC_115 yeah that sounds really hard
325_utt_DAIC_116 how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
325_utt_DAIC_117 almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um
325_utt_DAIC_118 about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep 
325_utt_DAIC_119 sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep
325_utt_DAIC_120 okay
325_utt_DAIC_121 what are you like when you don't sleep well
325_utt_DAIC_122 um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i
325_utt_DAIC_123 i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um
325_utt_DAIC_124 i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile
325_utt_DAIC_125 i see
325_utt_DAIC_126 when was the last time that happened
325_utt_DAIC_127 probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i can't sleep and so that's what happens  
325_utt_DAIC_128 okay
325_utt_DAIC_129 when was the last time you felt really happy
325_utt_DAIC_130 uh <makes sound with mouth>
325_utt_DAIC_131 really happy i mean um
325_utt_DAIC_132 i don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's
325_utt_DAIC_133 really happy on new year's eve which was um
325_utt_DAIC_134 uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them
325_utt_DAIC_135 i don't get to see them very often um because i've been in school and i've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life
325_utt_DAIC_136 that's great
325_utt_DAIC_137 what would you say are some of your best qualities

328_utt_DAIC_28 oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies 
328_utt_DAIC_29 how did you decide to do that 
328_utt_DAIC_30 well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film
328_utt_DAIC_31 that's great 
328_utt_DAIC_32 <laughter> 
328_utt_DAIC_33 when was the last time that happened 
328_utt_DAIC_34 last time i made a film just this last october made a short film 
328_utt_DAIC_35 what was it about
328_utt_DAIC_36 <laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally
328_utt_DAIC_37 mhm
328_utt_DAIC_38 that sounds interesting 
328_utt_DAIC_39 thanks <laughter> 
328_utt_DAIC_40 what are some things that make you really mad 
328_utt_DAIC_41 really mad uh 
328_utt_DAIC_42 <laughter> really mad i
328_utt_DAIC_43 you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad 
328_utt_DAIC_44 uh oh 
328_utt_DAIC_45 yeah 
328_utt_DAIC_46 that sucks 
328_utt_DAIC_47 <laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school 
328_utt_DAIC_48 do you find it easy to be a parent 
328_utt_DAIC_49 no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that
328_utt_DAIC_50 you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you
328_utt_DAIC_51 you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um
328_utt_DAIC_52 other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy  
328_utt_DAIC_53 yeah 
328_utt_DAIC_54 what's the hardest thing about being a parent 
328_utt_DAIC_55 <sigh> 
328_utt_DAIC_56 the hardest thing about being a parent 
328_utt_DAIC_57 i would say is
328_utt_DAIC_58 trying to give
328_utt_DAIC_59 that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so
328_utt_DAIC_60 it gets very uh 
328_utt_DAIC_61 um
328_utt_DAIC_62 annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt
328_utt_DAIC_63 it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so   
328_utt_DAIC_64 uh huh
328_utt_DAIC_65 that sounds really hard 
328_utt_DAIC_66 mm
328_utt_DAIC_67 yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch
328_utt_DAIC_68 but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it
328_utt_DAIC_69 you as a parent you're happy they got it 
328_utt_DAIC_70 that's good
328_utt_DAIC_71 what's the best thing about being a parent 
328_utt_DAIC_72 <sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they 
328_utt_DAIC_73 aw
328_utt_DAIC_74 yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs
328_utt_DAIC_75 she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but
328_utt_DAIC_76 <laughter> 
328_utt_DAIC_77 you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for
328_utt_DAIC_78 having the children tell you that you're a good person so
328_utt_DAIC_79 i like that 
328_utt_DAIC_80 yeah
328_utt_DAIC_81 that's so good to hear 
328_utt_DAIC_82 hmm
328_utt_DAIC_83 what do you think of today's kids 
328_utt_DAIC_84 oh <laughter> my god they're
328_utt_DAIC_85 ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity
328_utt_DAIC_86 and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but
328_utt_DAIC_87 they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or
328_utt_DAIC_88 you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information
328_utt_DAIC_89 and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed
328_utt_DAIC_90 uh huh 
328_utt_DAIC_91 and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong
328_utt_DAIC_92 yeah i see what you mean 
328_utt_DAIC_93 hmm
328_utt_DAIC_94 what do you do when you're annoyed 
328_utt_DAIC_95 me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation 
328_utt_DAIC_96 okay

328_utt_DAIC_185 scrubbed_entry
328_utt_DAIC_186 had uh these bag of m and m's and we had went to a play
328_utt_DAIC_187 and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for but you know that's how kids are you just they don't know how to you know they say they don't like somebody but you know
328_utt_DAIC_188 <laughter> 
328_utt_DAIC_189 anyway but we got these m and m's and while the it was dark we start throwing m and m's and hitting 'em in the head with the m and m's and then we came to school like three days later uh we were summoned and there was a mock trial
328_utt_DAIC_190 to get
328_utt_DAIC_191 <laughter> 
328_utt_DAIC_192 scrubbed_entry
328_utt_DAIC_193 so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime
328_utt_DAIC_194 uh oh 
328_utt_DAIC_195 and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like two days 
328_utt_DAIC_196 aw

328_utt_DAIC_210 i understand 
328_utt_DAIC_211 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
328_utt_DAIC_212 advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago
328_utt_DAIC_213 i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should've just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more 
328_utt_DAIC_214 mhm
328_utt_DAIC_215 okay 
328_utt_DAIC_216 when was the last time you felt really happy

333_utt_DAIC_122 like what
333_utt_DAIC_123 uh certain jobs

336_utt_DAIC_191 tell me more about that
336_utt_DAIC_192 uh well i went to that seminar i got there i was able to
336_utt_DAIC_193 take off work and <yawn> <sniffle> be in a different environment 'cause my job is stressful and <sniffle>
336_utt_DAIC_194 my life is stressful so
336_utt_DAIC_195 uh <sniffle> i was able to take a break which is great
336_utt_DAIC_196 that's good
336_utt_DAIC_197 how would your best friend describe you
336_utt_DAIC_198 uh i'd say i'm outgoing fun smart
336_utt_DAIC_199 uh
336_utt_DAIC_200 but i mean in l_a people in l_a they don't want to most of them don't want to spend time with you
336_utt_DAIC_201 uh huh
336_utt_DAIC_202 i don't know if that's because of me or l_a
336_utt_DAIC_203 i see what you mean
336_utt_DAIC_204 that makes sense
336_utt_DAIC_205 <laughter>
336_utt_DAIC_206 is there anything you regret
336_utt_DAIC_207 uh
336_utt_DAIC_208 that i spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward
336_utt_DAIC_209 could you have done anything to avoid it
336_utt_DAIC_210 avoid it yeah
336_utt_DAIC_211 watching t_v or going to see movies or <sniffle> trying not to think of it but it doesn't solve the problem
336_utt_DAIC_212 has that gotten you in trouble
336_utt_DAIC_213 uh well a little bit i haven't paid my bills a lot i still owe money <sniffle> so um
336_utt_DAIC_214 it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy <proph> prophecy 
336_utt_DAIC_215 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
336_utt_DAIC_216 uh stop criticizing and
336_utt_DAIC_217 start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen

339_utt_DAIC_109 did you think you had a problem before you found out
339_utt_DAIC_110 um i just knew that
339_utt_DAIC_111 i often thought about situations that um happened in the past and
339_utt_DAIC_112 kinda blamed the situation for my future
339_utt_DAIC_113 and um
339_utt_DAIC_114 are they triggered by something
339_utt_DAIC_115 um
339_utt_DAIC_116 certain
339_utt_DAIC_117 settings
339_utt_DAIC_118 can you tell me about that
339_utt_DAIC_119 um if i 
339_utt_DAIC_120 um see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when i was younger when things happened and changed my future plans
339_utt_DAIC_121 so i um try to i used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time
339_utt_DAIC_122 but now i feel like i um
339_utt_DAIC_123 just handle things better as far as
339_utt_DAIC_124 um
339_utt_DAIC_125 being in the similar settings with similar people i just
339_utt_DAIC_126 i see
339_utt_DAIC_127 i um handle those things better
339_utt_DAIC_128 that's good
339_utt_DAIC_129 do you still go to therapy now
339_utt_DAIC_130 i do
339_utt_DAIC_131 is going to a therapist helping you
339_utt_DAIC_132 um i like to believe that it does
339_utt_DAIC_133 what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
339_utt_DAIC_134 i
339_utt_DAIC_135 don't worry as much
339_utt_DAIC_136 how has seeing a therapist affected you  
339_utt_DAIC_137 um it's just allowed me to
339_utt_DAIC_138 know that actually speaking about the issues
339_utt_DAIC_139 um
339_utt_DAIC_140 relieves me of the tension of um
339_utt_DAIC_141 holding them inside so
339_utt_DAIC_142 that's how it's helped me
339_utt_DAIC_143 yeah how hard is that
339_utt_DAIC_144 at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it um
339_utt_DAIC_145 it actually is good because i know that when things are occurring 
339_utt_DAIC_146 um if i'm able to um communicate about them with a certain individual
339_utt_DAIC_147 mhm
339_utt_DAIC_148 it um relieves me of the stress of
339_utt_DAIC_149 of uh trying to figure out everything alone and often times um by speaking about the issues it um
339_utt_DAIC_150 allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be be better just because i'm hearing myself speak of the issue 
339_utt_DAIC_151 that's good
339_utt_DAIC_152 what got you to seek help
339_utt_DAIC_153 um i was diagnosed with depression and um my doctor felt that i should probably see the therapist
339_utt_DAIC_154 are you happy you did that
339_utt_DAIC_155 um i am
339_utt_DAIC_156 okay
339_utt_DAIC_157 how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
339_utt_DAIC_158 it depends um if i'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do

344_utt_DAIC_217 uh they he would describe me as a fun loving good person always there that try to help others uh 
344_utt_DAIC_218 think more of others really than more of myself but when i know i need things need to be done for me i take care of it
344_utt_DAIC_219 so you know and they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me
344_utt_DAIC_220 mhm
344_utt_DAIC_221 yeah they see something in me they wish that they had  
344_utt_DAIC_222 do you consider yourself an introvert 
344_utt_DAIC_223 excuse me ma'am
344_utt_DAIC_224 do you consider yourself an introvert 
344_utt_DAIC_225 uh can you be a little bit more specific 
344_utt_DAIC_226 let's come back to that later 
344_utt_DAIC_227 oh okay 
344_utt_DAIC_228 what do you do to relax 
344_utt_DAIC_229 uh books crossword puzzles
344_utt_DAIC_230 uh walking
344_utt_DAIC_231 that's about it 
344_utt_DAIC_232 okay 
344_utt_DAIC_233 is there anything you regret 
344_utt_DAIC_234 i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because 
344_utt_DAIC_235 this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on 
344_utt_DAIC_236 because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future 
344_utt_DAIC_237 yeah 
344_utt_DAIC_238 mhm i see what you mean 
344_utt_DAIC_239 yeah 
344_utt_DAIC_240 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
344_utt_DAIC_241 <sharp inhale>
344_utt_DAIC_242 uh <sigh> more education uh 
344_utt_DAIC_243 being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing
344_utt_DAIC_244 like i am today so yeah that's what i was lacking maybe twenty years ago 
344_utt_DAIC_245 okay 
344_utt_DAIC_246 who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life 
344_utt_DAIC_247 uh yes <ye> yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life 
344_utt_DAIC_248 can you give me an example of that 
344_utt_DAIC_249 uh <sigh>
344_utt_DAIC_250 yeah some people would uh uh uh well consistently <cons> xxx i mean consistently motivate me
344_utt_DAIC_251 to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot
344_utt_DAIC_252 and uh
344_utt_DAIC_253 he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done  
344_utt_DAIC_254 yeah

344_utt_DAIC_268 and school was one of 'em uh 
344_utt_DAIC_269 and just being just school was one of 'em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me 
344_utt_DAIC_270 mhm
344_utt_DAIC_271 yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as you're willing to do that i'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school

350_utt_DAIC_92 there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences 
350_utt_DAIC_93 tell me more about that 
350_utt_DAIC_94 well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her 
350_utt_DAIC_95 because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children 
350_utt_DAIC_96 and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to  
350_utt_DAIC_97 you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to 
350_utt_DAIC_98 you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible

350_utt_DAIC_166 when was the last time you felt really happy 
350_utt_DAIC_167 i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um  
350_utt_DAIC_168 last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays 
350_utt_DAIC_169 i'd love to hear all about it 
350_utt_DAIC_170 uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me
350_utt_DAIC_171 and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um
350_utt_DAIC_172 that's about it 
350_utt_DAIC_173 okay 
350_utt_DAIC_174 how would your best friend describe you 
350_utt_DAIC_175 how would my best friend describe me probably as um 
350_utt_DAIC_176 quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious 
350_utt_DAIC_177 um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and
350_utt_DAIC_178 they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or
350_utt_DAIC_179 um easy to talk to um
350_utt_DAIC_180 that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them 
350_utt_DAIC_181 aw 
350_utt_DAIC_182 that's great 
350_utt_DAIC_183 <laughter> 
350_utt_DAIC_184 is there anything you regret
350_utt_DAIC_185 um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff 
350_utt_DAIC_186 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
350_utt_DAIC_187 to just 
350_utt_DAIC_188 relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people
350_utt_DAIC_189 because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you
350_utt_DAIC_190 are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their 
350_utt_DAIC_191 their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just
350_utt_DAIC_192 believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be 
350_utt_DAIC_193 yeah 
350_utt_DAIC_194 yeah 
350_utt_DAIC_195 that makes sense 
350_utt_DAIC_196 tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed 
350_utt_DAIC_197 um really enjoyed working with um well 
350_utt_DAIC_198 okay

350_utt_DAIC_201 what are you most proud of in your life 
350_utt_DAIC_202 um being the first to attend college in my family

350_utt_DAIC_204 uh i'm most proud of being able to 
350_utt_DAIC_205 have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and
350_utt_DAIC_206 help someone else improve and better themself as well  
350_utt_DAIC_207 that sounds like a great situation

351_utt_DAIC_74 how hard is that
351_utt_DAIC_75 um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion 
351_utt_DAIC_76 yeah i understand
351_utt_DAIC_77 what's one of your most memorable experiences

351_utt_DAIC_105 yes
351_utt_DAIC_106 how long ago were you diagnosed
351_utt_DAIC_107 gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago
351_utt_DAIC_108 what got you to seek help
351_utt_DAIC_109 um
351_utt_DAIC_110 i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff
351_utt_DAIC_111 do you still go to therapy now
351_utt_DAIC_112 um not currently i i did about like six months ago
351_utt_DAIC_113 why did you stop
351_utt_DAIC_114 um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and
351_utt_DAIC_115 xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change
351_utt_DAIC_116 yeah i'm sorry to hear that
351_utt_DAIC_117 it's okay <laughter>
351_utt_DAIC_118 do you feel like therapy is useful
351_utt_DAIC_119 um yes i do actually um 
351_utt_DAIC_120 when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do
351_utt_DAIC_121 what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
351_utt_DAIC_122 um
351_utt_DAIC_123 i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um
351_utt_DAIC_124 when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um   
351_utt_DAIC_125 also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself
351_utt_DAIC_126 so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat>
351_utt_DAIC_127 that's good
351_utt_DAIC_128 what were your symptoms
351_utt_DAIC_129 um
351_utt_DAIC_130 feeling hopeless all the time
351_utt_DAIC_131 not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues 
351_utt_DAIC_132 um
351_utt_DAIC_133 having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life 
351_utt_DAIC_134 are they triggered by something
351_utt_DAIC_135 um
351_utt_DAIC_136 sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me 
351_utt_DAIC_137 how do you cope with them
351_utt_DAIC_138 um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal
351_utt_DAIC_139 to record things
351_utt_DAIC_140 mhm
351_utt_DAIC_141 <clears throat> 
351_utt_DAIC_142 how have you been feeling lately
351_utt_DAIC_143 um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter> 
351_utt_DAIC_144 have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
351_utt_DAIC_145 um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it
351_utt_DAIC_146 okay
351_utt_DAIC_147 how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
351_utt_DAIC_148 um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult
351_utt_DAIC_149 why
351_utt_DAIC_150 um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat>
351_utt_DAIC_151 what are you like when you don't sleep well
351_utt_DAIC_152 um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um
351_utt_DAIC_153 that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter>
351_utt_DAIC_154 okay
351_utt_DAIC_155 when was the last time you felt really happy

351_utt_DAIC_178 um
351_utt_DAIC_179 don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um

351_utt_DAIC_187 so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher
351_utt_DAIC_188 um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out

351_utt_DAIC_194 um
351_utt_DAIC_195 i was really kind of like um 
351_utt_DAIC_196 reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat>
351_utt_DAIC_197 so uh and then i went a worked in a um
351_utt_DAIC_198 mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so

352_utt_DAIC_17 how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
352_utt_DAIC_18 um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter> 
352_utt_DAIC_19 why'd you move to l_a
352_utt_DAIC_20 um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean

352_utt_DAIC_32 to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends 
352_utt_DAIC_33 what are some things that make you really mad 
352_utt_DAIC_34 things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people
352_utt_DAIC_35 um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter> 
352_utt_DAIC_36 what do you do when you're annoyed 
352_utt_DAIC_37 when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but
352_utt_DAIC_38 i try to just
352_utt_DAIC_39 like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything 
352_utt_DAIC_40 how are you at controlling your temper 
352_utt_DAIC_41 um
352_utt_DAIC_42 it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like
352_utt_DAIC_43 like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it 
352_utt_DAIC_44 when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about 
352_utt_DAIC_45 <sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone
352_utt_DAIC_46 it was probably with my parents um
352_utt_DAIC_47 i've been having some some car trouble lately and
352_utt_DAIC_48 i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that
352_utt_DAIC_49 i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues 
352_utt_DAIC_50 how close are you to your family 
352_utt_DAIC_51 i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time

352_utt_DAIC_55 she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways 
352_utt_DAIC_56 what's one of your most memorable experiences 
352_utt_DAIC_57 oh

352_utt_DAIC_63 what do you enjoy about traveling 
352_utt_DAIC_64 uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um
352_utt_DAIC_65 because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's
352_utt_DAIC_66 all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the
352_utt_DAIC_67 diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool 
352_utt_DAIC_68 have you ever served in the military 
352_utt_DAIC_69 no i have not served in the military <laughter> 
352_utt_DAIC_70 have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
352_utt_DAIC_71 nope
352_utt_DAIC_72 have you been diagnosed with depression 
352_utt_DAIC_73 no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've
352_utt_DAIC_74 i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah  
352_utt_DAIC_75 how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep 
352_utt_DAIC_76 lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep
352_utt_DAIC_77 or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me  
352_utt_DAIC_78 what are you like when you don't sleep well 
352_utt_DAIC_79 i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function 
352_utt_DAIC_80 how have you been feeling lately 
352_utt_DAIC_81 i've been feeling really good um 
352_utt_DAIC_82 over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and
352_utt_DAIC_83 that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through
352_utt_DAIC_84 a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and
352_utt_DAIC_85 so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter>
352_utt_DAIC_86 have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately 
352_utt_DAIC_87 um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more 
352_utt_DAIC_88 positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and
352_utt_DAIC_89 of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to
352_utt_DAIC_90 kind of
352_utt_DAIC_91 just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more
352_utt_DAIC_92 confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>   
352_utt_DAIC_93 when was the last time you felt really happy 
352_utt_DAIC_94 oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um 
352_utt_DAIC_95 i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and
352_utt_DAIC_96 it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and
352_utt_DAIC_97 um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just
352_utt_DAIC_98 like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter> 
352_utt_DAIC_99 how would your best friend describe you 
352_utt_DAIC_100 my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and
352_utt_DAIC_101 bold and fearless um
352_utt_DAIC_102 that i'm unique
352_utt_DAIC_103 and artistic
352_utt_DAIC_104 and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter> 
352_utt_DAIC_105 what are you most proud of in your life 
352_utt_DAIC_106 um 
352_utt_DAIC_107 probably
352_utt_DAIC_108 just like
352_utt_DAIC_109 the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very
352_utt_DAIC_110 exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and
352_utt_DAIC_111 i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and
352_utt_DAIC_112 i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles 
352_utt_DAIC_113 is there anything you regret 
352_utt_DAIC_114 oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so
352_utt_DAIC_115 i wouldn't really change anything 
352_utt_DAIC_116 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
352_utt_DAIC_117 oh <sigh>
352_utt_DAIC_118 i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i 
352_utt_DAIC_119 should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because
352_utt_DAIC_120 um
352_utt_DAIC_121 i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just
352_utt_DAIC_122 tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do 
352_utt_DAIC_123 tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed 
352_utt_DAIC_124 oh 
352_utt_DAIC_125 let's see that's kind of hard <laughter> 
352_utt_DAIC_126 um oh i guess
352_utt_DAIC_127 i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since
352_utt_DAIC_128 i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so
352_utt_DAIC_129 um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun 
352_utt_DAIC_130 okay i think i've asked everything i need to
352_utt_DAIC_131 cool
352_utt_DAIC_132 thanks for sharing your thoughts with me

353_utt_DAIC_13 why'd you move to l_a
353_utt_DAIC_14 mhm
353_utt_DAIC_15 um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life
353_utt_DAIC_16 uh huh 
353_utt_DAIC_17 how often do you go back to your hometown 
353_utt_DAIC_18 um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once
353_utt_DAIC_19 how does it compare to l_a
353_utt_DAIC_20 a year
353_utt_DAIC_21 um
353_utt_DAIC_22 definitely safer and um definitely a more um
353_utt_DAIC_23 well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here
353_utt_DAIC_24 yeah
353_utt_DAIC_25 how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
353_utt_DAIC_26 um 
353_utt_DAIC_27 not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment

353_utt_DAIC_36 what's your dream job
353_utt_DAIC_37 um i wanna be an osteopathic physician 
353_utt_DAIC_38 tell me more about that 
353_utt_DAIC_39 um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who
353_utt_DAIC_40 helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live 
353_utt_DAIC_41 a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine 
353_utt_DAIC_42 cool 
353_utt_DAIC_43 how did you decide to do that 
353_utt_DAIC_44 um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast  
353_utt_DAIC_45 uh huh 
353_utt_DAIC_46 do you consider yourself an introvert  
353_utt_DAIC_47 um sometimes 
353_utt_DAIC_48 why
353_utt_DAIC_49 um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and
353_utt_DAIC_50 eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups
353_utt_DAIC_51 okay 
353_utt_DAIC_52 what are some things that make you really mad
353_utt_DAIC_53 um
353_utt_DAIC_54 eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings 
353_utt_DAIC_55 what do you do when you're annoyed 
353_utt_DAIC_56 um i usually 
353_utt_DAIC_57 try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated 
353_utt_DAIC_58 how are you at controlling your temper
353_utt_DAIC_59 um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset  
353_utt_DAIC_60 that's good
353_utt_DAIC_61 when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about 
353_utt_DAIC_62 um <sigh> let's see
353_utt_DAIC_63 uh mm
353_utt_DAIC_64 i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case 
353_utt_DAIC_65 uh oh
353_utt_DAIC_66 that sounds really hard 
353_utt_DAIC_67 yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers  
353_utt_DAIC_68 okay 
353_utt_DAIC_69 how would your best friend describe you 
353_utt_DAIC_70 i have no idea <laughter> 
353_utt_DAIC_71 what would you say are some of your best qualities 
353_utt_DAIC_72 um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um
353_utt_DAIC_73 i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people
353_utt_DAIC_74 um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em 
353_utt_DAIC_75 uh huh
353_utt_DAIC_76 have you ever served in the military 
353_utt_DAIC_77 no
353_utt_DAIC_78 have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
353_utt_DAIC_79 yes 
353_utt_DAIC_80 how long ago were you diagnosed 
353_utt_DAIC_81 um just a few months ago about in the last six months 
353_utt_DAIC_82 what got you to seek help 
353_utt_DAIC_83 um i was
353_utt_DAIC_84 experiencing 
353_utt_DAIC_85 mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't 
353_utt_DAIC_86 um
353_utt_DAIC_87 i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself 
353_utt_DAIC_88 mhm
353_utt_DAIC_89 how have you been feeling lately 
353_utt_DAIC_90 um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um 
353_utt_DAIC_91 that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working  
353_utt_DAIC_92 are they triggered by something 
353_utt_DAIC_93 um 
353_utt_DAIC_94 i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so
353_utt_DAIC_95 um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings
353_utt_DAIC_96 and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out
353_utt_DAIC_97 i see what you mean 
353_utt_DAIC_98 how do you cope with them 
353_utt_DAIC_99 um
353_utt_DAIC_100 well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um 
353_utt_DAIC_101 and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and
353_utt_DAIC_102 i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that  
353_utt_DAIC_103 i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home   
353_utt_DAIC_104 okay 
353_utt_DAIC_105 how has seeing a therapist affected you 
353_utt_DAIC_106 um 
353_utt_DAIC_107 it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um
353_utt_DAIC_108 i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling 
353_utt_DAIC_109 do you still go to therapy now

355_utt_DAIC_44 that's alright 
355_utt_DAIC_45 what are some things that make you really mad 
355_utt_DAIC_46 uh <sigh> people who are chicken heads they get their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers you expect that from a family member
355_utt_DAIC_47 or or a friend but you know
355_utt_DAIC_48 i see what you mean 
355_utt_DAIC_49 especially with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what orwell was referring to when he spoke of big brother in nineteen eighty four 
355_utt_DAIC_50 mhm
355_utt_DAIC_51 what do you do when you're annoyed 
355_utt_DAIC_52 uh i don't do much
355_utt_DAIC_53 much different than i would otherwise 
355_utt_DAIC_54 how are you at controlling your temper 
355_utt_DAIC_55 uh and i've had many temper outbursts
355_utt_DAIC_56 that's good
355_utt_DAIC_57 when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about 
355_utt_DAIC_58 uh 
355_utt_DAIC_59 i kinda argue with my aunt 
355_utt_DAIC_60 and it was because she was basically 
355_utt_DAIC_61 making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative
355_utt_DAIC_62 and uh it annoyed me greatly  
355_utt_DAIC_63 how close are you to your family 
355_utt_DAIC_64 uh i'm kind of on the outs with my parents 
355_utt_DAIC_65 why

355_utt_DAIC_67 i understand 
355_utt_DAIC_68 who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life 
355_utt_DAIC_69 oh uh i mean my mom's done the most to help me

355_utt_DAIC_77 with all she had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did 
355_utt_DAIC_78 wow
355_utt_DAIC_79 yeah 
355_utt_DAIC_80 what's one of your most memorable experiences 
355_utt_DAIC_81 oh probably uh 
355_utt_DAIC_82 going down to the cape at the end of uh baja peninsula there's cabo san lucas
355_utt_DAIC_83 or taking <ta> photographing the bridalveil falls in yosemite 
355_utt_DAIC_84 how did you feel in that moment 
355_utt_DAIC_85 uh it was probably the two most majestic seen <see> sights i've ever seen 
355_utt_DAIC_86 that sounds like a great situation 
355_utt_DAIC_87 it was when i could afford to travel

355_utt_DAIC_120 why
355_utt_DAIC_121 because i'm restless 
355_utt_DAIC_122 are they triggered by something 
355_utt_DAIC_123 no
355_utt_DAIC_124 but now that i'm old i i i sleep much more easily

355_utt_DAIC_129 mm
355_utt_DAIC_130 when was the last time you felt really happy 
355_utt_DAIC_131 i don't know probably uh 
355_utt_DAIC_132 can't have any specific remembrances 
355_utt_DAIC_133 of of that you know it was when i had money to spend i know that and when i had to have a job to have money to spend so it was probably
355_utt_DAIC_134 fifteen years ago 
355_utt_DAIC_135 tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed 
355_utt_DAIC_136 well
355_utt_DAIC_137 i haven't really enjoyed anything uh last week i did a uh
355_utt_DAIC_138 made seventy five dollars on a job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and they enlisted people to play
355_utt_DAIC_139 the basically the relatives of people who had been in a in a
355_utt_DAIC_140 fall uh bombing at the staples center and we you know asked questions signed up you know told 'em gave 'em the information i'm missing 
355_utt_DAIC_141 you know relatives and basically it was provided by the county
355_utt_DAIC_142 and basically went through a routine in downtown l_a 
355_utt_DAIC_143 how hard is that 
355_utt_DAIC_144 not not hard it was just uh
355_utt_DAIC_145 just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually
355_utt_DAIC_146 missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their characteristics height weight etcetera   
355_utt_DAIC_147 wow
355_utt_DAIC_148 how would your best friend describe you 
355_utt_DAIC_149 i don't have a best friend 
355_utt_DAIC_150 what would you say are some of your best qualities
355_utt_DAIC_151 uh 
355_utt_DAIC_152 i'm uh very bright
355_utt_DAIC_153 i'm a
355_utt_DAIC_154 perfectionist at my job 
355_utt_DAIC_155 i'd say that's about it 
355_utt_DAIC_156 what are you most proud of in your life 
355_utt_DAIC_157 i got a business degree and i've never been a motivated person i went to school i went to
355_utt_DAIC_158 two state colleges and two
355_utt_DAIC_159 junior colleges to meet that end so i believe that was probably the most significant contribution <con> contribution that i i made to my 
355_utt_DAIC_160 you know to my uh i guess self esteem you might say so i had something to hang on the wall 
355_utt_DAIC_161 yeah
355_utt_DAIC_162 that's great 
355_utt_DAIC_163 is there anything you regret

355_utt_DAIC_165 alienating family members 
355_utt_DAIC_166 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
355_utt_DAIC_167 i would've uh 
355_utt_DAIC_168 basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs thinking <think> thinking that 
355_utt_DAIC_169 you know i could always get another one and not you know
355_utt_DAIC_170 basically blow off jobs i could probably work at one of the employers that i used to work for now 
355_utt_DAIC_171 they've added locations but i burned bridges there so that's not possible 
355_utt_DAIC_172 mhm

356_utt_DAIC_54 well
356_utt_DAIC_55 i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences 
356_utt_DAIC_56 whatever comes to your mind 
356_utt_DAIC_57 oh
356_utt_DAIC_58 well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school
356_utt_DAIC_59 there was a few of the things that i was happy about
356_utt_DAIC_60 and
356_utt_DAIC_61 some art pieces i've made were memorable
356_utt_DAIC_62 and 
356_utt_DAIC_63 some bad things would be my father's death you know but those are very memorable not good though 
356_utt_DAIC_64 mhm
356_utt_DAIC_65 who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life 
356_utt_DAIC_66 uh 
356_utt_DAIC_67 well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so <s> so the my family
356_utt_DAIC_68 how close are you to your family 
356_utt_DAIC_69 uh fairly close but they most of them live around l_a
356_utt_DAIC_70 uh there's a few that are from far <f>
356_utt_DAIC_71 distant <di> uh distant my brother lives in new york and  
356_utt_DAIC_72 my other brother lives in maui <clears throat> 
356_utt_DAIC_73 wow
356_utt_DAIC_74 mhm
356_utt_DAIC_75 what do you think of today's kids
356_utt_DAIC_76 oh mostly very talented
356_utt_DAIC_77 <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was
356_utt_DAIC_78 or am and they're um
356_utt_DAIC_79 i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up
356_utt_DAIC_80 just seems like they were all hooked into social media 
356_utt_DAIC_81 yeah
356_utt_DAIC_82 i understand
356_utt_DAIC_83 what do you do to relax 
356_utt_DAIC_84 uh go on a walk or
356_utt_DAIC_85 watch television 
356_utt_DAIC_86 mhm
356_utt_DAIC_87 or play with my computer 
356_utt_DAIC_88 and uh
356_utt_DAIC_89 what are some things that make you really mad
356_utt_DAIC_90 um well 
356_utt_DAIC_91 there's some <so> some
356_utt_DAIC_92 uh 
356_utt_DAIC_93 there's some kind of uh 
356_utt_DAIC_94 injustices that happen in not
356_utt_DAIC_95 not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking
356_utt_DAIC_96 eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna 
356_utt_DAIC_97 oh 
356_utt_DAIC_98 uh make any exceptions or change some rules 
356_utt_DAIC_99 and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups>
356_utt_DAIC_100 uh that are upsetting
356_utt_DAIC_101 can you give me an example of that 
356_utt_DAIC_102 uh yeah
356_utt_DAIC_103 i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site  
356_utt_DAIC_104 the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside 
356_utt_DAIC_105 and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside
356_utt_DAIC_106 um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained
356_utt_DAIC_107 that we were late setting up when it when they told us
356_utt_DAIC_108 to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and 
356_utt_DAIC_109 and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so
356_utt_DAIC_110 uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job 
356_utt_DAIC_111 oh no
356_utt_DAIC_112 that's yeah that's how they do things
356_utt_DAIC_113 so that that is upsetting 
356_utt_DAIC_114 how do you cope with them 
356_utt_DAIC_115 uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are
356_utt_DAIC_116 that might be better
356_utt_DAIC_117 um 
356_utt_DAIC_118 that's good 
356_utt_DAIC_119 yeah 
356_utt_DAIC_120 how are you at controlling your temper 
356_utt_DAIC_121 uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx
356_utt_DAIC_122 might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that
356_utt_DAIC_123 but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that 
356_utt_DAIC_124 mhm
356_utt_DAIC_125 when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about 
356_utt_DAIC_126 um
356_utt_DAIC_127 well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we
356_utt_DAIC_128 we were arguing where to go first 
356_utt_DAIC_129 and um so we compromised and
356_utt_DAIC_130 did most of her things and one of my things then after 
356_utt_DAIC_131 this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so
356_utt_DAIC_132 but it
356_utt_DAIC_133 that's good 
356_utt_DAIC_134 yeah 
356_utt_DAIC_135 have you ever served in the military 
356_utt_DAIC_136 no
356_utt_DAIC_137 have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
356_utt_DAIC_138 post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is 
356_utt_DAIC_139 mhm
356_utt_DAIC_140 uh
356_utt_DAIC_141 no i have not
356_utt_DAIC_142 have you been diagnosed with depression 
356_utt_DAIC_143 yes 
356_utt_DAIC_144 how long ago were you diagnosed 
356_utt_DAIC_145 oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty
356_utt_DAIC_146 yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty
356_utt_DAIC_147 that's a long time 
356_utt_DAIC_148 yeah 
356_utt_DAIC_149 what got you to seek help 
356_utt_DAIC_150 um
356_utt_DAIC_151 well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist 
356_utt_DAIC_152 what were your symptoms 
356_utt_DAIC_153 um
356_utt_DAIC_154 well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house 
356_utt_DAIC_155 um i was waking up at
356_utt_DAIC_156 noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um
356_utt_DAIC_157 focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough
356_utt_DAIC_158 uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression 
356_utt_DAIC_159 yeah 
356_utt_DAIC_160 did you think you had a problem before you found out 
356_utt_DAIC_161 yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was 
356_utt_DAIC_162 do you still go to therapy now 
356_utt_DAIC_163 no
356_utt_DAIC_164 why did you stop 
356_utt_DAIC_165 uh well
356_utt_DAIC_166 eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that 
356_utt_DAIC_167 he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh
356_utt_DAIC_168 and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on
356_utt_DAIC_169 with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days 
356_utt_DAIC_170 what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
356_utt_DAIC_171 um
356_utt_DAIC_172 i think therapy makes you see what the um 
356_utt_DAIC_173 like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really
356_utt_DAIC_174 you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of
356_utt_DAIC_175 try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately 
356_utt_DAIC_176 or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint
356_utt_DAIC_177 and i try to look for clues about that  
356_utt_DAIC_178 that makes sense 
356_utt_DAIC_179 mhm
356_utt_DAIC_180 how have you been feeling lately 
356_utt_DAIC_181 i think i'm um
356_utt_DAIC_182 slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods
356_utt_DAIC_183 i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for
356_utt_DAIC_184 for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important
356_utt_DAIC_185 it um
356_utt_DAIC_186 yeah 
356_utt_DAIC_187 it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and
356_utt_DAIC_188 deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed  
356_utt_DAIC_189 uh huh
356_utt_DAIC_190 have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately 
356_utt_DAIC_191 uh 
356_utt_DAIC_192 well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are
356_utt_DAIC_193 probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i
356_utt_DAIC_194 have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um
356_utt_DAIC_195 um
356_utt_DAIC_196 soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with 
356_utt_DAIC_197 mm
356_utt_DAIC_198 you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and 
356_utt_DAIC_199 the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and
356_utt_DAIC_200 yeah 
356_utt_DAIC_201 eh things like that or um
356_utt_DAIC_202 some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that 
356_utt_DAIC_203 where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that 
356_utt_DAIC_204 okay 
356_utt_DAIC_205 yeah
356_utt_DAIC_206 is there anything you regret 
356_utt_DAIC_207 oh you mean in life in general yeah well
356_utt_DAIC_208 i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa>
356_utt_DAIC_209 uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well
356_utt_DAIC_210 and um didn't really
356_utt_DAIC_211 i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have

356_utt_DAIC_213 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
356_utt_DAIC_214 um 
356_utt_DAIC_215 i think it would've been to um 
356_utt_DAIC_216 at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some
356_utt_DAIC_217 uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics
356_utt_DAIC_218 i had i was an art major and i had no car so  
356_utt_DAIC_219 a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and
356_utt_DAIC_220 and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to

363_utt_DAIC_103 and so she needs to
363_utt_DAIC_104 uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh
363_utt_DAIC_105 someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child
363_utt_DAIC_106 yeah_downer (yeah)
363_utt_DAIC_107 feelguilty (what's something you feel guilty about)
363_utt_DAIC_108 probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage
363_utt_DAIC_109 um as far as um
363_utt_DAIC_110 the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife
363_utt_DAIC_111 give_example (can you give me an example of that)
363_utt_DAIC_112 uh yeah i um
363_utt_DAIC_113 got caught up in a situation where
363_utt_DAIC_114 um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart
363_utt_DAIC_115 and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so
363_utt_DAIC_116 you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money
363_utt_DAIC_117 and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship
363_utt_DAIC_118 had to do with trust because um
363_utt_DAIC_119 it it was devastating to my wife
363_utt_DAIC_120 yeah_downer (yeah)
363_utt_DAIC_121 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
363_utt_DAIC_122 i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light
363_utt_DAIC_123 um i felt very guilty
363_utt_DAIC_124 and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life
363_utt_DAIC_125 im_sorry (i'm sorry)

363_utt_DAIC_136 behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately)
363_utt_DAIC_137 no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um
363_utt_DAIC_138 after i had my heart attack a few years ago
363_utt_DAIC_139 um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before
363_utt_DAIC_140 so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that
363_utt_DAIC_141 thats_great (that's great)
363_utt_DAIC_142 happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
363_utt_DAIC_143 the last time i felt really happy
363_utt_DAIC_144 um
363_utt_DAIC_145 probably when
363_utt_DAIC_146 i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack
363_utt_DAIC_147 and um
363_utt_DAIC_148 he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that
363_utt_DAIC_149 he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue
363_utt_DAIC_150 no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack
363_utt_DAIC_151 and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications
363_utt_DAIC_152 good_hear (that's so good to hear)
363_utt_DAIC_153 self_change (what are some things you wish you could change about yourself)
363_utt_DAIC_154 well i guess number one thing is uh
363_utt_DAIC_155 my physical being itself
363_utt_DAIC_156 i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight
363_utt_DAIC_157 um
363_utt_DAIC_158 just in general just be more healthier physically
363_utt_DAIC_159 and as far as mentally um just not
363_utt_DAIC_160 go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish
363_utt_DAIC_161 symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
363_utt_DAIC_162 just one day at a time
363_utt_DAIC_163 you know i just uh
363_utt_DAIC_164 try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis
363_utt_DAIC_165 i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself
363_utt_DAIC_166 i do things to help myself
363_utt_DAIC_167 mm (mm)
363_utt_DAIC_168 regret (is there anything you regret)
363_utt_DAIC_169 well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage
363_utt_DAIC_170 uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and
363_utt_DAIC_171 and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but
363_utt_DAIC_172 um
363_utt_DAIC_173 at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done
363_utt_DAIC_174 so i don't focus too much on the past
363_utt_DAIC_175 i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day
363_utt_DAIC_176 yeah_downer (yeah)
363_utt_DAIC_177 advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
363_utt_DAIC_178 what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing
363_utt_DAIC_179 to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed
363_utt_DAIC_180 um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh
363_utt_DAIC_181 i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um
363_utt_DAIC_182 scrubbed_entry
363_utt_DAIC_183 you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately
363_utt_DAIC_184 uh_huh (uh huh)
363_utt_DAIC_185 Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)
363_utt_DAIC_186 probably
363_utt_DAIC_187 the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that
363_utt_DAIC_188 um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that
363_utt_DAIC_189 um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive
363_utt_DAIC_190 uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy
363_utt_DAIC_191 and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh
363_utt_DAIC_192 just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night
363_utt_DAIC_193 one day at a time
363_utt_DAIC_194 yeah3 (yeah)
363_utt_DAIC_195 difficult (how hard is that)
363_utt_DAIC_196 it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where
363_utt_DAIC_197 you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines
363_utt_DAIC_198 and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore
363_utt_DAIC_199 mhm (mhm)
363_utt_DAIC_200 BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)

363_utt_DAIC_203 um a nice person to be around
363_utt_DAIC_204 and um
363_utt_DAIC_205 you know

363_utt_DAIC_213 um i go to a local park and uh it's about
363_utt_DAIC_214 this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning
363_utt_DAIC_215 um

364_utt_DAIC_7 thats_good (that's good)
364_utt_DAIC_8 where_originally (where are you from originally)
364_utt_DAIC_9 i was born and raised in los angeles
364_utt_DAIC_10 and i'm one of the few locals from around here
364_utt_DAIC_11 and uh i went to school away and uh
364_utt_DAIC_12 but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles
364_utt_DAIC_13 really (really)
364_utt_DAIC_14 yes i am
364_utt_DAIC_15 like_about_LA (what are some things you really like about l_a)
364_utt_DAIC_16 i like the weather
364_utt_DAIC_17 having owned a vacation house in another state
364_utt_DAIC_18 that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here
364_utt_DAIC_19 um i like the culture i like the diversity
364_utt_DAIC_20 i like the familiarity
364_utt_DAIC_21 i like that beaches
364_utt_DAIC_22 uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert
364_utt_DAIC_23 but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that
364_utt_DAIC_24 and uh i think it's a great place to live
364_utt_DAIC_25 yeah2 (yeah)
364_utt_DAIC_26 see_mean (i see what you mean)
364_utt_DAIC_27 thank you
364_utt_DAIC_28 dont_like_LA (what are some things you don't really like about l_a)
364_utt_DAIC_29 well
364_utt_DAIC_30 more of some maybe some of the
364_utt_DAIC_31 things i don't like about l_a or say california in general
364_utt_DAIC_32 say like the high tax rate
364_utt_DAIC_33 which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now
364_utt_DAIC_34 which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations
364_utt_DAIC_35 i'm a small business owner
364_utt_DAIC_36 so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated
364_utt_DAIC_37 and uh that's a big problem here in uh
364_utt_DAIC_38 uh california
364_utt_DAIC_39 that_sucks (that sucks)
364_utt_DAIC_40 it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh
364_utt_DAIC_41 also uh
364_utt_DAIC_42 you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't
364_utt_DAIC_43 see that but it's a big tax on the social service system
364_utt_DAIC_44 and that's what makes our taxes
364_utt_DAIC_45 uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of
364_utt_DAIC_46 mm (mm)
364_utt_DAIC_47 so that's
364_utt_DAIC_48 you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state
364_utt_DAIC_49 mhm (mhm)
364_utt_DAIC_50 travel_shoes (i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot)
364_utt_DAIC_51 i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries
364_utt_DAIC_52 and uh
364_utt_DAIC_53 i don't travel as much as i used to
364_utt_DAIC_54 but i've traveled quite a bit
364_utt_DAIC_55 and i've learned a couple of languages and uh
364_utt_DAIC_56 i served
364_utt_DAIC_57 like_what (like what)
364_utt_DAIC_58 i'm sorry
364_utt_DAIC_59 like_what (like what)
364_utt_DAIC_60 uh
364_utt_DAIC_61 i didn't really understand uh your question
364_utt_DAIC_62 when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and
364_utt_DAIC_63 i've been all through europe eastern europe
364_utt_DAIC_64 asia
364_utt_DAIC_65 south america
364_utt_DAIC_66 north africa
364_utt_DAIC_67 um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf
364_utt_DAIC_68 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up
364_utt_DAIC_69 and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga
364_utt_DAIC_70 and work out and uh
364_utt_DAIC_71 i try to eat healthy and uh
364_utt_DAIC_72 that's a big part of my life
364_utt_DAIC_73 travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips)
364_utt_DAIC_74 oh
364_utt_DAIC_75 sure
364_utt_DAIC_76 um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span
364_utt_DAIC_77 but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times
364_utt_DAIC_78 we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local
364_utt_DAIC_79 and rented a small flat and
364_utt_DAIC_80 cooked and did our own shopping but really
364_utt_DAIC_81 having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days
364_utt_DAIC_82 it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city
364_utt_DAIC_83 and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french
364_utt_DAIC_84 which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger
364_utt_DAIC_85 my mother insisted that all of us kids
364_utt_DAIC_86 take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh
364_utt_DAIC_87 all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school
364_utt_DAIC_88 nice (nice)
364_utt_DAIC_89 so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french
364_utt_DAIC_90 with the french
364_utt_DAIC_91 you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me
364_utt_DAIC_92 wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
364_utt_DAIC_93 <laughter> so that was a
364_utt_DAIC_94 study (what did you study at school)
364_utt_DAIC_95 uh
364_utt_DAIC_96 i have a few different degrees
364_utt_DAIC_97 so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate
364_utt_DAIC_98 and uh
364_utt_DAIC_99 that was fun
364_utt_DAIC_100 and i also have a masters
364_utt_DAIC_101 uh degree in economics
364_utt_DAIC_102 and i have a degree in crisis management
364_utt_DAIC_103 so
364_utt_DAIC_104 change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
364_utt_DAIC_105 uh i found them um
364_utt_DAIC_106 interesting
364_utt_DAIC_107 and uh
364_utt_DAIC_108 it was something that i wanted to do
364_utt_DAIC_109 where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports
364_utt_DAIC_110 and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland
364_utt_DAIC_111 and i originally wanted to be a doctor but
364_utt_DAIC_112 once you start going to school
364_utt_DAIC_113 for a little bit you change your mind
364_utt_DAIC_114 etcetera so
364_utt_DAIC_115 mhm (mhm)
364_utt_DAIC_116 still_working_on_X (are you still working in that)
364_utt_DAIC_117 um i'm actually in the wholesale business now
364_utt_DAIC_118 for wholesale distributors of furniture products
364_utt_DAIC_119 and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago
364_utt_DAIC_120 well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business
364_utt_DAIC_121 and it's
364_utt_DAIC_122 pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it
364_utt_DAIC_123 but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past
364_utt_DAIC_124 dream_job (what's your dream job)
364_utt_DAIC_125 hm
364_utt_DAIC_126 actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home
364_utt_DAIC_127 and uh
364_utt_DAIC_128 uh
364_utt_DAIC_129 i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter
364_utt_DAIC_130 and uh
364_utt_DAIC_131 aw (aw)
364_utt_DAIC_132 you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked
364_utt_DAIC_133 but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids
364_utt_DAIC_134 you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life
364_utt_DAIC_135 so
364_utt_DAIC_136 yeah3 (yeah)
364_utt_DAIC_137 probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun
364_utt_DAIC_138 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
364_utt_DAIC_139 uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers
364_utt_DAIC_140 but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable
364_utt_DAIC_141 i think i'm more of an extrovert
364_utt_DAIC_142 whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted
364_utt_DAIC_143 but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation
364_utt_DAIC_144 and be more um
364_utt_DAIC_145 introverted
364_utt_DAIC_146 i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved
364_utt_DAIC_147 okay_confirm (okay)
364_utt_DAIC_148 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
364_utt_DAIC_149 oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh
364_utt_DAIC_150 one of my i have uh several computers at home
364_utt_DAIC_151 and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well
364_utt_DAIC_152 i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach
364_utt_DAIC_153 you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes
364_utt_DAIC_154 it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years
364_utt_DAIC_155 i had
364_utt_DAIC_156 it uh
364_utt_DAIC_157 i usually find exercise helps me relax the best
364_utt_DAIC_158 or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>
364_utt_DAIC_159 but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but
364_utt_DAIC_160 thats_great (that's great)
364_utt_DAIC_161 yes that was uh
364_utt_DAIC_162 that was it but
364_utt_DAIC_163 that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills
364_utt_DAIC_164 i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years
364_utt_DAIC_165 i think i've gotten better
364_utt_DAIC_166 uh at the
364_utt_DAIC_167 yeah2 (yeah)
364_utt_DAIC_168 i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature
364_utt_DAIC_169 as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and
364_utt_DAIC_170 be a little more
364_utt_DAIC_171 how do you had had the skills earlier
364_utt_DAIC_172 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
364_utt_DAIC_173 i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged
364_utt_DAIC_174 um
364_utt_DAIC_175 you know i
364_utt_DAIC_176 i am more likely to think before i speak now
364_utt_DAIC_177 whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought
364_utt_DAIC_178 so i might've said more things that i
364_utt_DAIC_179 in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or
364_utt_DAIC_180 a work situation
364_utt_DAIC_181 um
364_utt_DAIC_182 but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it
364_utt_DAIC_183 i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties
364_utt_DAIC_184 uh_huh (uh huh)
364_utt_DAIC_185 so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity
364_utt_DAIC_186 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
364_utt_DAIC_187 oh wow
364_utt_DAIC_188 you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional
364_utt_DAIC_189 argument um
364_utt_DAIC_190 probably
364_utt_DAIC_191 um
364_utt_DAIC_192 my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter
364_utt_DAIC_193 and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just
364_utt_DAIC_194 basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting
364_utt_DAIC_195 and uh just
364_utt_DAIC_196 uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused
364_utt_DAIC_197 us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument
364_utt_DAIC_198 but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree
364_utt_DAIC_199 butt heads
364_utt_DAIC_200 so
364_utt_DAIC_201 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
364_utt_DAIC_202 i felt like i was talking to a wall
364_utt_DAIC_203 and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've
364_utt_DAIC_204 learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should
364_utt_DAIC_205 usually have but you're not really thinking of that because
364_utt_DAIC_206 sometimes when we're younger we're
364_utt_DAIC_207 looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me
364_utt_DAIC_208 but you know
364_utt_DAIC_209 i'm pretty easy going and i have
364_utt_DAIC_210 different
364_utt_DAIC_211 ideas on raising children how she did
364_utt_DAIC_212 and that was more
364_utt_DAIC_213 not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really
364_utt_DAIC_214 discussed those things but it was really just fundamental
364_utt_DAIC_215 reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match
364_utt_DAIC_216 yeah_downer (yeah)
364_utt_DAIC_217 whereas other things looked good
364_utt_DAIC_218 you know on paper to both of us
364_utt_DAIC_219 mhm (mhm)
364_utt_DAIC_220 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
364_utt_DAIC_221 hm
364_utt_DAIC_222 there's one recently my father passed away uh recently
364_utt_DAIC_223 im_sorry (i'm sorry)
364_utt_DAIC_224 thank you
364_utt_DAIC_225 and
364_utt_DAIC_226 really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days
364_utt_DAIC_227 and i really only invited very very close friends and family members
364_utt_DAIC_228 i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of
364_utt_DAIC_229 not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a
364_utt_DAIC_230 i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact
364_utt_DAIC_231 that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known
364_utt_DAIC_232 about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but
364_utt_DAIC_233 now as time's passed i wish i'd invited
364_utt_DAIC_234 more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends
364_utt_DAIC_235 you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just
364_utt_DAIC_236 and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because
364_utt_DAIC_237 i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but
364_utt_DAIC_238 i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little
364_utt_DAIC_239 they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that
364_utt_DAIC_240 you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less
364_utt_DAIC_241 doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really
364_utt_DAIC_242 mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so
364_utt_DAIC_243 isee_downer (i see)
364_utt_DAIC_244 family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
364_utt_DAIC_245 um well both my parents are recently
364_utt_DAIC_246 uh deceased in the last couple of years
364_utt_DAIC_247 and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away
364_utt_DAIC_248 in december
364_utt_DAIC_249 and
364_utt_DAIC_250 we're not super close like i always like i look at other families
364_utt_DAIC_251 we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting
364_utt_DAIC_252 i guess we're also uh different
364_utt_DAIC_253 Ellie17Dec2012_02 (uh huh)
364_utt_DAIC_254 and uh
364_utt_DAIC_255 i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family
364_utt_DAIC_256 not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that
364_utt_DAIC_257 we just
364_utt_DAIC_258 never did that because we're all
364_utt_DAIC_259 all so uh
364_utt_DAIC_260 uh different
364_utt_DAIC_261 yeah2 (yeah)
364_utt_DAIC_262 understand (i understand)
364_utt_DAIC_263 yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but
364_utt_DAIC_264 you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know
364_utt_DAIC_265 but i think every family has their own sort of
364_utt_DAIC_266 stuff
364_utt_DAIC_267 ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d)
364_utt_DAIC_268 um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from
364_utt_DAIC_269 some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from
364_utt_DAIC_270 you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was
364_utt_DAIC_271 but i think i function
364_utt_DAIC_272 pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years
364_utt_DAIC_273 why_enlist (why'd you decide to enlist in the military)
364_utt_DAIC_274 i didn't enlist i was an officer
364_utt_DAIC_275 i went to one of the service academies
364_utt_DAIC_276 old (how old were you when you joined the military)
364_utt_DAIC_277 that
364_utt_DAIC_278 um seventeen i started when after high school
364_utt_DAIC_279 and i went to a service academy
364_utt_DAIC_280 so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into
364_utt_DAIC_281 very_young (you were very young weren't you)
364_utt_DAIC_282 i was but same age as everybody else that went there
364_utt_DAIC_283 combat (did you ever see combat)
364_utt_DAIC_284 uh we did
364_utt_DAIC_285 nineteen eighty three
364_utt_DAIC_286 tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
364_utt_DAIC_287 um
364_utt_DAIC_288 just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just
364_utt_DAIC_289 we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled
364_utt_DAIC_290 at the time
364_utt_DAIC_291 and poison gas was sprayed on us
364_utt_DAIC_292 so
364_utt_DAIC_293 Ellie17Dec2012_06 (wow)
364_utt_DAIC_294 that was a
364_utt_DAIC_295 it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh
364_utt_DAIC_296 too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation
364_utt_DAIC_297 why2 (why)
364_utt_DAIC_298 that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you
364_utt_DAIC_299 you actually play in the game and the same with uh
364_utt_DAIC_300 you know if you're in a combat
364_utt_DAIC_301 unit
364_utt_DAIC_302 mhm (mhm)
364_utt_DAIC_303 effectB (how did serving in the military change you)
364_utt_DAIC_304 well it made me more patriotic having grown up
364_utt_DAIC_305 in california
364_utt_DAIC_306 whereas people who are from all over the country
364_utt_DAIC_307 and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did
364_utt_DAIC_308 never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i
364_utt_DAIC_309 ended up becoming uh
364_utt_DAIC_310 just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country
364_utt_DAIC_311 whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or
364_utt_DAIC_312 georgia north dakota south dakota montana
364_utt_DAIC_313 right2 (right)
364_utt_DAIC_314 grows up with that kind of uh
364_utt_DAIC_315 pride so i thought it was good and it
364_utt_DAIC_316 unlike so many of my friends that
364_utt_DAIC_317 they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan
364_utt_DAIC_318 after (what did you do after the military)
364_utt_DAIC_319 uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school
364_utt_DAIC_320 and i got two graduate degrees
364_utt_DAIC_321 and i went to work in private enterprise
364_utt_DAIC_322 uh
364_utt_DAIC_323 didn't care for it
364_utt_DAIC_324 then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic
364_utt_DAIC_325 for a number of years and
364_utt_DAIC_326 then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell
364_utt_DAIC_327 civilian_life (how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life)
364_utt_DAIC_328 um
364_utt_DAIC_329 at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked
364_utt_DAIC_330 and again i was an officer
364_utt_DAIC_331 uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile
364_utt_DAIC_332 to be able to come back to los angeles
364_utt_DAIC_333 uh
364_utt_DAIC_334 because it was just so uh
364_utt_DAIC_335 so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality
364_utt_DAIC_336 so but
364_utt_DAIC_337 mm (mm)
364_utt_DAIC_338 it was a great experience
364_utt_DAIC_339 thats_good (that's good)
364_utt_DAIC_340 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
364_utt_DAIC_341 um
364_utt_DAIC_342 it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late
364_utt_DAIC_343 and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well
364_utt_DAIC_344 even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um
364_utt_DAIC_345 but i generally sleep uh
364_utt_DAIC_346 i generally sleep pretty well
364_utt_DAIC_347 feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
364_utt_DAIC_348 i feel pretty good lately
364_utt_DAIC_349 you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but
364_utt_DAIC_350 boy the last few months i feel great pretty much
364_utt_DAIC_351 behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately)
364_utt_DAIC_352 no not really
364_utt_DAIC_353 i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately
364_utt_DAIC_354 okay_confirm (okay)
364_utt_DAIC_355 depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression)
364_utt_DAIC_356 um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it
364_utt_DAIC_357 and
364_utt_DAIC_358 you know
364_utt_DAIC_359 it wasn't
364_utt_DAIC_360 anything real too debilitating
364_utt_DAIC_361 and i wasn't able to really function
364_utt_DAIC_362 on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling
364_utt_DAIC_363 therapy_useful (do you feel like therapy is useful)
364_utt_DAIC_364 i do i was really against it in the past
364_utt_DAIC_365 and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh
364_utt_DAIC_366 my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past
364_utt_DAIC_367 i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous
364_utt_DAIC_368 and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it
364_utt_DAIC_369 why_seek_help (what got you to seek help)
364_utt_DAIC_370 oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about
364_utt_DAIC_371 life relationships
364_utt_DAIC_372 and sometimes it's good talking things out with a
364_utt_DAIC_373 a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger
364_utt_DAIC_374 understand (i understand)
364_utt_DAIC_375 so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and
364_utt_DAIC_376 i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that
364_utt_DAIC_377 therapy_going (do you still go to therapy now)
364_utt_DAIC_378 uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off
364_utt_DAIC_379 i do have someone that i go to
364_utt_DAIC_380 okay_confirm (okay)
364_utt_DAIC_381 yeah
364_utt_DAIC_382 therapist_affect (how has seeing a therapist affected you)
364_utt_DAIC_383 i think it's nice
364_utt_DAIC_384 you know they really
364_utt_DAIC_385 if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped
364_utt_DAIC_386 they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's
364_utt_DAIC_387 always in the past they just help you talk through your
364_utt_DAIC_388 your thoughts
364_utt_DAIC_389 and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity
364_utt_DAIC_390 yeah2 (yeah)
364_utt_DAIC_391 to the situation that's why i like
364_utt_DAIC_392 talking to someone who has a lot more life experience
364_utt_DAIC_393 and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man
364_utt_DAIC_394 uh_huh (uh huh)
364_utt_DAIC_395 so but it's
364_utt_DAIC_396 um
364_utt_DAIC_397 i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and
364_utt_DAIC_398 was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you
364_utt_DAIC_399 but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good
364_utt_DAIC_400 uh_huh (uh huh)
364_utt_DAIC_401 happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
364_utt_DAIC_402 uh this morning
364_utt_DAIC_403 i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and
364_utt_DAIC_404 family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather
364_utt_DAIC_405 and i have a bunch of errands to run
364_utt_DAIC_406 and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out
364_utt_DAIC_407 and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold
364_utt_DAIC_408 where i always i know that term so
364_utt_DAIC_409 but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day
364_utt_DAIC_410 thats_great (that's great)
364_utt_DAIC_411 and i looked forward to feeling the sun
364_utt_DAIC_412 so
364_utt_DAIC_413 BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
364_utt_DAIC_414 uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects
364_utt_DAIC_415 i'm too smart for my own good
364_utt_DAIC_416 and i'm a
364_utt_DAIC_417 i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational
364_utt_DAIC_418 i'm very resourceful
364_utt_DAIC_419 people always call me when they have issues
364_utt_DAIC_420 and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go
364_utt_DAIC_421 whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or
364_utt_DAIC_422 you know i'm great with medical diagnoses
364_utt_DAIC_423 uh
364_utt_DAIC_424 and uh
364_utt_DAIC_425 you know people also say i'm a lot of fun
364_utt_DAIC_426 mhm (mhm)
364_utt_DAIC_427 i'm fun to be with
364_utt_DAIC_428 and um
364_utt_DAIC_429 i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white
364_utt_DAIC_430 i am what i am
364_utt_DAIC_431 i don't b_s
364_utt_DAIC_432 you know
364_utt_DAIC_433 i'm the opposite of a politician
364_utt_DAIC_434 so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them
364_utt_DAIC_435 yeah3 (yeah)
364_utt_DAIC_436 so that's pretty much
364_utt_DAIC_437 landed_trouble (has that gotten you in trouble)
364_utt_DAIC_438 no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully
364_utt_DAIC_439 okay_confirm (okay)
364_utt_DAIC_440 i like to think i do
364_utt_DAIC_441 regret (is there anything you regret)
364_utt_DAIC_442 uh
364_utt_DAIC_443 probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy
364_utt_DAIC_444 uh
364_utt_DAIC_445 i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger
364_utt_DAIC_446 uh
364_utt_DAIC_447 but just a lot of it's very typical
364_utt_DAIC_448 advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
364_utt_DAIC_449 really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive
364_utt_DAIC_450 or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now
364_utt_DAIC_451 i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking
364_utt_DAIC_452 in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices
364_utt_DAIC_453 Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)
364_utt_DAIC_454 um i'm proud of my daughter she's
364_utt_DAIC_455 a nice young lady i am uh
364_utt_DAIC_456 proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my
364_utt_DAIC_457 military service and fire service
364_utt_DAIC_458 um there are very few people like me who did it
364_utt_DAIC_459 who are as
364_utt_DAIC_460 had the background in education that i did but i like public service
364_utt_DAIC_461 and um
364_utt_DAIC_462 so i'm proud of uh that
364_utt_DAIC_463 mhm (mhm)

366_utt_DAIC_238 basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college
366_utt_DAIC_239 um so <s> i went <we> i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother

366_utt_DAIC_247 and um
366_utt_DAIC_248 i wasn't doing well in a_p calculus because i decided to go to a j_c first and transfer also to save money for college too
366_utt_DAIC_249 and when i told him you know the teacher called saying i was falling asleep in class um just because mind you after school i'd work an eight hour shift 'cause i was a retail manager at the time
366_utt_DAIC_250 so um
366_utt_DAIC_251 and i'd come home after that shift to do homework mm calculus let alone
366_utt_DAIC_252 um so uh
366_utt_DAIC_253 um he would get upset and i told him i spoke with my counselor i already told him that i don't need that class to go to the j_c isn't something that i continue with so i'm just gonna i can't drop out

366_utt_DAIC_256 take the
366_utt_DAIC_257 d or fail whatever

366_utt_DAIC_259 and so
366_utt_DAIC_260 he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him
366_utt_DAIC_261 you know since you're my father you should act like it
366_utt_DAIC_262 but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> way i said it so

366_utt_DAIC_266 um and that is i wish i continued
366_utt_DAIC_267 um with college throughout
366_utt_DAIC_268 like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at
366_utt_DAIC_269 i wanna say nineteen

368_utt_DAIC_267 and and you know it's one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family
368_utt_DAIC_268 feel that i don't put a lot of
368_utt_DAIC_269 time and attention to them i mean they think that i'm pretty great when i do give 'em the my
368_utt_DAIC_270 time of day and my attention but um i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really
368_utt_DAIC_271 you know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different
368_utt_DAIC_272 i don't <don> i don't know if i really can give 'em eh a a real
368_utt_DAIC_273 you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know i'll i'll usually do it
368_utt_DAIC_274 you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know like if they
368_utt_DAIC_275 you know
368_utt_DAIC_276 if they really need me then i'll do it you know eh if they're just asking for a favor
368_utt_DAIC_277 i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness
368_utt_DAIC_278 i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like
368_utt_DAIC_279 i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um
368_utt_DAIC_280 you know uh
368_utt_DAIC_281 like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends
368_utt_DAIC_282 but it's the same time i i just feel like it's
368_utt_DAIC_283 it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a
368_utt_DAIC_284 a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know
368_utt_DAIC_285 gotta do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know and i in in the end i do like 'em and they probably would do it for me

370_utt_DAIC_8 where_originally (where are you from originally)
370_utt_DAIC_9 uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley

370_utt_DAIC_11 yeah
370_utt_DAIC_12 like_about_LA (what are some things you really like about l_a)
370_utt_DAIC_13 uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um
370_utt_DAIC_14 the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um
370_utt_DAIC_15 camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like
370_utt_DAIC_16 eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that
370_utt_DAIC_17 that i i i would say i like that too
370_utt_DAIC_18 cool3 (cool)
370_utt_DAIC_19 dont_like_LA (what are some things you don't really like about l_a)
370_utt_DAIC_20 <laughter> probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like traffic i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like <deep breath>
370_utt_DAIC_21 uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um
370_utt_DAIC_22 and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know
370_utt_DAIC_23 that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but
370_utt_DAIC_24 that's fine
370_utt_DAIC_25 uh_huh (uh huh)
370_utt_DAIC_26 job_virtually (i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job)
370_utt_DAIC_27 wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter>
370_utt_DAIC_28 i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow
370_utt_DAIC_29 make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but
370_utt_DAIC_30 that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if
370_utt_DAIC_31 if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things
370_utt_DAIC_32 and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun
370_utt_DAIC_33 travel_changed (what do you enjoy about traveling)
370_utt_DAIC_34 well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be
370_utt_DAIC_35 eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um
370_utt_DAIC_36 i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also
370_utt_DAIC_37 fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um
370_utt_DAIC_38 yeah3 (yeah)
370_utt_DAIC_39 so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great
370_utt_DAIC_40 travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips)
370_utt_DAIC_41 uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last
370_utt_DAIC_42 trip i i
370_utt_DAIC_43 took um
370_utt_DAIC_44 lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um
370_utt_DAIC_45 well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um
370_utt_DAIC_46 austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age
370_utt_DAIC_47 yeah2 (yeah)
370_utt_DAIC_48 so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um
370_utt_DAIC_49 like
370_utt_DAIC_50 tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life
370_utt_DAIC_51 i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and
370_utt_DAIC_52 so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my
370_utt_DAIC_53 my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to
370_utt_DAIC_54 traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and
370_utt_DAIC_55 it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it
370_utt_DAIC_56 awesome (awesome)
370_utt_DAIC_57 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
370_utt_DAIC_58 uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so
370_utt_DAIC_59 i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like
370_utt_DAIC_60 familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um
370_utt_DAIC_61 maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh
370_utt_DAIC_62 like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that
370_utt_DAIC_63 uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really
370_utt_DAIC_64 relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and
370_utt_DAIC_65 i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax
370_utt_DAIC_66 uh_huh (uh huh)
370_utt_DAIC_67 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
370_utt_DAIC_68 i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so
370_utt_DAIC_69 i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um
370_utt_DAIC_70 yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't
370_utt_DAIC_71 i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all
370_utt_DAIC_72 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
370_utt_DAIC_73 the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh>
370_utt_DAIC_74 i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about
370_utt_DAIC_75 things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict
370_utt_DAIC_76 as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um
370_utt_DAIC_77 really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't
370_utt_DAIC_78 sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing
370_utt_DAIC_79 okay_confirm (okay)
370_utt_DAIC_80 feelguilty (what's something you feel guilty about)
370_utt_DAIC_81 something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um
370_utt_DAIC_82 i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um
370_utt_DAIC_83 i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not
370_utt_DAIC_84 even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or
370_utt_DAIC_85 running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait
370_utt_DAIC_86 waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true
370_utt_DAIC_87 see_mean (i see what you mean)
370_utt_DAIC_88 memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
370_utt_DAIC_89 um <sigh> hmm
370_utt_DAIC_90 um nothing immediately comes to mind i
370_utt_DAIC_91 well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh
370_utt_DAIC_92 was um
370_utt_DAIC_93 driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow
370_utt_DAIC_94 rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like
370_utt_DAIC_95 reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but
370_utt_DAIC_96 it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they
370_utt_DAIC_97 you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um
370_utt_DAIC_98 <deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened
370_utt_DAIC_99 yeah3 (yeah)
370_utt_DAIC_100 that_sucks (that sucks)
370_utt_DAIC_101 it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck
370_utt_DAIC_102 okay_confirm (okay)
370_utt_DAIC_103 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
370_utt_DAIC_104 well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh
370_utt_DAIC_105 i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up
370_utt_DAIC_106 'til one or two every night uh and
370_utt_DAIC_107 it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were
370_utt_DAIC_108 more um
370_utt_DAIC_109 able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven
370_utt_DAIC_110 mhm (mhm)
370_utt_DAIC_111 and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to
370_utt_DAIC_112 going to sleep later and waking up later
370_utt_DAIC_113 yeah3 (yeah)
370_utt_DAIC_114 feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
370_utt_DAIC_115 i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um
370_utt_DAIC_116 you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh
370_utt_DAIC_117 um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that
370_utt_DAIC_118 behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately)
370_utt_DAIC_119 no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um
370_utt_DAIC_120 everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening
370_utt_DAIC_121 okay_confirm (okay)
370_utt_DAIC_122 ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d)
370_utt_DAIC_123 no
370_utt_DAIC_124 depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression)
370_utt_DAIC_125 no
370_utt_DAIC_126 regret (is there anything you regret)
370_utt_DAIC_127 well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh>
370_utt_DAIC_128 in my life uh yeah like i said i
370_utt_DAIC_129 i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i
370_utt_DAIC_130 there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh
370_utt_DAIC_131 i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we
370_utt_DAIC_132 we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life
370_utt_DAIC_133 advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
370_utt_DAIC_134 i would say that um <sigh>
370_utt_DAIC_135 it's important to
370_utt_DAIC_136 to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um
370_utt_DAIC_137 recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from
370_utt_DAIC_138 the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um
370_utt_DAIC_139 kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which
370_utt_DAIC_140 eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um
370_utt_DAIC_141 that approach it's kinda fatalistic
370_utt_DAIC_142 and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that
370_utt_DAIC_143 it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of
370_utt_DAIC_144 you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place
370_utt_DAIC_145 mm (mm)
370_utt_DAIC_146 makes_sense (that makes sense)
370_utt_DAIC_147 feelbadly (tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself)
370_utt_DAIC_148 um <sigh>
370_utt_DAIC_149 well i <sigh>
370_utt_DAIC_150 i i guess when people i i don't especially um
370_utt_DAIC_151 take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that
370_utt_DAIC_152 so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is
370_utt_DAIC_153 uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized
370_utt_DAIC_154 i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should
370_utt_DAIC_155 bouts_symptoms (when was the last time that happened)
370_utt_DAIC_156 uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody
370_utt_DAIC_157 just out of uh college you know um
370_utt_DAIC_158 went over what we had done and
370_utt_DAIC_159 you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and
370_utt_DAIC_160 i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh
370_utt_DAIC_161 it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um
370_utt_DAIC_162 i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh
370_utt_DAIC_163 not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of
370_utt_DAIC_164 you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that
370_utt_DAIC_165 the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but
370_utt_DAIC_166 you know it wasn't our call <sigh>
370_utt_DAIC_167 yeah_downer (yeah)
370_utt_DAIC_168 memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences)
370_utt_DAIC_169 mm most memorable experiences um
370_utt_DAIC_170 well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um
370_utt_DAIC_171 the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um
370_utt_DAIC_172 for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest
370_utt_DAIC_173 period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i
370_utt_DAIC_174 i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um
370_utt_DAIC_175 and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun
370_utt_DAIC_176 nice (nice)
370_utt_DAIC_177 happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
370_utt_DAIC_178 uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we
370_utt_DAIC_179 aw (aw)
370_utt_DAIC_180 we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty
370_utt_DAIC_181 happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been
370_utt_DAIC_182 very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so

372_utt_DAIC_81 it's so spontaneous
372_utt_DAIC_82 like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and
372_utt_DAIC_83 just brings a smile to your face
372_utt_DAIC_84 give_example (can you give me an example of that)
372_utt_DAIC_85 um
372_utt_DAIC_86 well when my son was younger
372_utt_DAIC_87 once we were just sitting around the house and
372_utt_DAIC_88 he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me
372_utt_DAIC_89 mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails
372_utt_DAIC_90 so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so
372_utt_DAIC_91 wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
372_utt_DAIC_92 yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen
372_utt_DAIC_93 that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore

372_utt_DAIC_98 not wanting to screw it up
372_utt_DAIC_99 i feel a lot of stress and pressure
372_utt_DAIC_100 that
372_utt_DAIC_101 every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter
372_utt_DAIC_102 in what kind of person my kid turns out to be
372_utt_DAIC_103 and
372_utt_DAIC_104 so
372_utt_DAIC_105 it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter>
372_utt_DAIC_106 been_hard (that sounds really hard)
372_utt_DAIC_107 yeah
372_utt_DAIC_108 too_hard (do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself)

372_utt_DAIC_113 um
372_utt_DAIC_114 hmm
372_utt_DAIC_115 i think
372_utt_DAIC_116 i'm different from my mom
372_utt_DAIC_117 because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction
372_utt_DAIC_118 i welcome it you know i welcome
372_utt_DAIC_119 getting to know who my child is right now
372_utt_DAIC_120 and
372_utt_DAIC_121 not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just
372_utt_DAIC_122 see them become the best
372_utt_DAIC_123 child that they can be the best adult that they can be without
372_utt_DAIC_124 molding them in that direction necessarily
372_utt_DAIC_125 yeah2 (yeah)
372_utt_DAIC_126 into a different person <laughter>
372_utt_DAIC_127 uh_huh (uh huh)
372_utt_DAIC_128 so
372_utt_DAIC_129 influence_positive (who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life)

372_utt_DAIC_135 mm

372_utt_DAIC_137 like that
372_utt_DAIC_138 okay_confirm (okay)
372_utt_DAIC_139 okay
372_utt_DAIC_140 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
372_utt_DAIC_141 well
372_utt_DAIC_142 i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it
372_utt_DAIC_143 often enough
372_utt_DAIC_144 um
372_utt_DAIC_145 i've tried
372_utt_DAIC_146 to like go for walks but i don't always do that
372_utt_DAIC_147 and i don't always stick with it
372_utt_DAIC_148 <laughter>
372_utt_DAIC_149 so
372_utt_DAIC_150 uh_huh (uh huh)
372_utt_DAIC_151 yeah that's about it
372_utt_DAIC_152 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
372_utt_DAIC_153 <sigh>
372_utt_DAIC_154 i'd say
372_utt_DAIC_155 i'm
372_utt_DAIC_156 a little below average meaning
372_utt_DAIC_157 that i get angry
372_utt_DAIC_158 more than most people do i think
372_utt_DAIC_159 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
372_utt_DAIC_160 hmm
372_utt_DAIC_161 last night
372_utt_DAIC_162 <laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband
372_utt_DAIC_163 um we have my sister lives with us
372_utt_DAIC_164 and she lives with us in a very small room with
372_utt_DAIC_165 a small apartment i should say
372_utt_DAIC_166 and she's got four people living in in one room so um
372_utt_DAIC_167 it's kind of stressful it's really crowded
372_utt_DAIC_168 and my husband is stressed out about it
372_utt_DAIC_169 and
372_utt_DAIC_170 you know i'm just saying to him that
372_utt_DAIC_171 i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here
372_utt_DAIC_172 then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do
372_utt_DAIC_173 that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded
372_utt_DAIC_174 and every day they're asking for rides and my husband
372_utt_DAIC_175 he's
372_utt_DAIC_176 avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore
372_utt_DAIC_177 and i'm just saying that
372_utt_DAIC_178 he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because
372_utt_DAIC_179 he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter>
372_utt_DAIC_180 hmm
372_utt_DAIC_181 that_sucks (that sucks)
372_utt_DAIC_182 it does <laughter>
372_utt_DAIC_183 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
372_utt_DAIC_184 oh
372_utt_DAIC_185 i've got tons of 'em but right now
372_utt_DAIC_186 what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son
372_utt_DAIC_187 um
372_utt_DAIC_188 right now like
372_utt_DAIC_189 i've been arguing with my stepmom
372_utt_DAIC_190 and
372_utt_DAIC_191 my stepsister for a long time about
372_utt_DAIC_192 my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated
372_utt_DAIC_193 like they don't have any boundaries
372_utt_DAIC_194 and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child
372_utt_DAIC_195 they let my child boss 'em around and stuff
372_utt_DAIC_196 anyways because of this
372_utt_DAIC_197 they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that
372_utt_DAIC_198 oh_no (oh no)
372_utt_DAIC_199 yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom
372_utt_DAIC_200 because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different
372_utt_DAIC_201 ideas about child raising
372_utt_DAIC_202 she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife
372_utt_DAIC_203 and
372_utt_DAIC_204 she's
372_utt_DAIC_205 she really doesn't she's really far removed from
372_utt_DAIC_206 how i was raised and i wanna raise my child
372_utt_DAIC_207 more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us
372_utt_DAIC_208 and
372_utt_DAIC_209 with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild
372_utt_DAIC_210 and have everything that he wants
372_utt_DAIC_211 and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes
372_utt_DAIC_212 and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules
372_utt_DAIC_213 and not
372_utt_DAIC_214 trying to go and break all of my rules
372_utt_DAIC_215 <sigh> anyway <laughter>
372_utt_DAIC_216 right2 (right)
372_utt_DAIC_217 makes_sense (that makes sense)
372_utt_DAIC_218 yeah
372_utt_DAIC_219 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
372_utt_DAIC_220 um in that moment <sigh>
372_utt_DAIC_221 just really frustrated because they don't listen to me
372_utt_DAIC_222 i feel
372_utt_DAIC_223 disrespected i feel
372_utt_DAIC_224 like invisible
372_utt_DAIC_225 i feel
372_utt_DAIC_226 just angry
372_utt_DAIC_227 that
372_utt_DAIC_228 they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do
372_utt_DAIC_229 i went to school and i studied child development
372_utt_DAIC_230 i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter>
372_utt_DAIC_231 i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities
372_utt_DAIC_232 and
372_utt_DAIC_233 to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent
372_utt_DAIC_234 try and tell me that i'm a bad parent
372_utt_DAIC_235 it's really
372_utt_DAIC_236 uh
372_utt_DAIC_237 hard to believe so i feel very disrespected
372_utt_DAIC_238 um
372_utt_DAIC_239 unacknowledged angry frustrated
372_utt_DAIC_240 all those things <laughter>
372_utt_DAIC_241 yeah_downer (yeah)
372_utt_DAIC_242 im_sorry (i'm sorry)
372_utt_DAIC_243 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
372_utt_DAIC_244 um
372_utt_DAIC_245 i take i take benadryl to help me sleep
372_utt_DAIC_246 and i'm
372_utt_DAIC_247 so
372_utt_DAIC_248 <laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep
372_utt_DAIC_249 and last night i was crying
372_utt_DAIC_250 before i went to sleep
372_utt_DAIC_251 so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed
372_utt_DAIC_252 but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily
372_utt_DAIC_253 <laughter>
372_utt_DAIC_254 hmm_downer (hmm)
372_utt_DAIC_255 trigger (are they triggered by something)
372_utt_DAIC_256 yeah i'm always thinking about my son
372_utt_DAIC_257 how i wish he was with me
372_utt_DAIC_258 and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle>
372_utt_DAIC_259 and like i don't deserve
372_utt_DAIC_260 to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom
372_utt_DAIC_261 you know
372_utt_DAIC_262 <sobbing>
372_utt_DAIC_263 yeah_downer (yeah)
372_utt_DAIC_264 and i'm too hard on myself so
372_utt_DAIC_265 but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom
372_utt_DAIC_266 i just
372_utt_DAIC_267 i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me
372_utt_DAIC_268 and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because
372_utt_DAIC_269 i know he can do more for him
372_utt_DAIC_270 financially than i could
372_utt_DAIC_271 but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom
372_utt_DAIC_272 <laughter>
372_utt_DAIC_273 hmm
372_utt_DAIC_274 yeah_downer (yeah)
372_utt_DAIC_275 feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
372_utt_DAIC_276 i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants
372_utt_DAIC_277 um
372_utt_DAIC_278 i take wellbutrin
372_utt_DAIC_279 i been on them for a couple weeks now
372_utt_DAIC_280 i think they're working i don't know
372_utt_DAIC_281 i'm not as
372_utt_DAIC_282 down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed <laughter> i made it out and i'm here today so
372_utt_DAIC_283 not that bad
372_utt_DAIC_284 why_seek_help (what got you to seek help)
372_utt_DAIC_285 um <sigh> hmm
372_utt_DAIC_286 my husband complains a lot he says
372_utt_DAIC_287 i'm not the same person
372_utt_DAIC_288 that i was when he married me
372_utt_DAIC_289 he said i was fun and i was positive and
372_utt_DAIC_290 i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle>
372_utt_DAIC_291 and
372_utt_DAIC_292 i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago
372_utt_DAIC_293 and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such
372_utt_DAIC_294 a shock
372_utt_DAIC_295 and um
372_utt_DAIC_296 i've just been trying to get back from it
372_utt_DAIC_297 but it's been hard
372_utt_DAIC_298 understand (i understand)
372_utt_DAIC_299 suspect_problem (did you think you had a problem before you found out)
372_utt_DAIC_300 did i think i had a problem before i found out

372_utt_DAIC_305 yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but
372_utt_DAIC_306 like um
372_utt_DAIC_307 my family would invite me
372_utt_DAIC_308 to family events
372_utt_DAIC_309 and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle>
372_utt_DAIC_310 or um
372_utt_DAIC_311 i don't know
372_utt_DAIC_312 it's just all the crying i think
372_utt_DAIC_313 and like i said my husband
372_utt_DAIC_314 letting me know that i'm not the same person
372_utt_DAIC_315 so
372_utt_DAIC_316 he's disappointed
372_utt_DAIC_317 and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too
372_utt_DAIC_318 another thing i'm feeling bad about

372_utt_DAIC_328 um
372_utt_DAIC_329 that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards
372_utt_DAIC_330 um

374_utt_DAIC_192 and you know

374_utt_DAIC_206 <deep breath> i think that therapy
374_utt_DAIC_207 is good for me because it
374_utt_DAIC_208 helps me focus on
374_utt_DAIC_209 my sort of patterns um
374_utt_DAIC_210 and also like
374_utt_DAIC_211 ah
374_utt_DAIC_212 just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like
374_utt_DAIC_213 um
374_utt_DAIC_214 kind of just reacting to situations i'm like
374_utt_DAIC_215 mm
374_utt_DAIC_216 just like noticing more what is going on um
374_utt_DAIC_217 and it just helps to
374_utt_DAIC_218 um
374_utt_DAIC_219 i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter>

374_utt_DAIC_232 and um
374_utt_DAIC_233 like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of
374_utt_DAIC_234 feeling
374_utt_DAIC_235 not
374_utt_DAIC_236 <laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me
374_utt_DAIC_237 um
374_utt_DAIC_238 so when i was there with them it just um
374_utt_DAIC_239 it just felt very like

374_utt_DAIC_241 warm familial embrace

374_utt_DAIC_251 and
374_utt_DAIC_252 um

374_utt_DAIC_258 memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
374_utt_DAIC_259 <deep breath> hmm <sigh>
374_utt_DAIC_260 okay um
374_utt_DAIC_261 so
374_utt_DAIC_262 this happened
374_utt_DAIC_263 the the last like
374_utt_DAIC_264 job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like
374_utt_DAIC_265 a year and a half close to two years and uh
374_utt_DAIC_266 i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat>
374_utt_DAIC_267 he sort of out of nowhere
374_utt_DAIC_268 uh
374_utt_DAIC_269 mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um
374_utt_DAIC_270 essentially like
374_utt_DAIC_271 the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project
374_utt_DAIC_272 so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah
374_utt_DAIC_273 and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer
374_utt_DAIC_274 and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how
374_utt_DAIC_275 he
374_utt_DAIC_276 i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know
374_utt_DAIC_277 even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore
374_utt_DAIC_278 he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic
374_utt_DAIC_279 decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me
374_utt_DAIC_280 but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic
374_utt_DAIC_281 yada yada so
374_utt_DAIC_282 to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me
374_utt_DAIC_283 um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point
374_utt_DAIC_284 he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me
374_utt_DAIC_285 and later on like a couple of months down the road
374_utt_DAIC_286 i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still
374_utt_DAIC_287 ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um
374_utt_DAIC_288 this guy who
374_utt_DAIC_289 had worked with us a bunch kind of like
374_utt_DAIC_290 if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff
374_utt_DAIC_291 he was doing my job so
374_utt_DAIC_292 oh_no (oh no)
374_utt_DAIC_293 yeah so it just like
374_utt_DAIC_294 it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like
374_utt_DAIC_295 that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like
374_utt_DAIC_296 in a way that's like
374_utt_DAIC_297 that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like
374_utt_DAIC_298 angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter>
374_utt_DAIC_299 yeah_downer (yeah)
374_utt_DAIC_300 im_sorry (i'm sorry)

376_utt_DAIC_158 arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i
376_utt_DAIC_159 was feeling desperate and hopeless
376_utt_DAIC_160 and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago
376_utt_DAIC_161 which caused me to be hospitalized
376_utt_DAIC_162 and then uh
376_utt_DAIC_163 they started treating me i started seeing a therapist
376_utt_DAIC_164 so
376_utt_DAIC_165 therapist_useful (is going to a therapist helping you)
376_utt_DAIC_166 um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist
376_utt_DAIC_167 but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some
376_utt_DAIC_168 avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me
376_utt_DAIC_169 i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there
376_utt_DAIC_170 and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this
376_utt_DAIC_171 and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback
376_utt_DAIC_172 as to how to deal with the emotions

376_utt_DAIC_178 um
376_utt_DAIC_179 like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication
376_utt_DAIC_180 um
376_utt_DAIC_181 there's been no changes really
376_utt_DAIC_182 i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver
376_utt_DAIC_183 and uh
376_utt_DAIC_184 even though a lot of times i
376_utt_DAIC_185 feeled i felt overwhelmed or
376_utt_DAIC_186 lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her
376_utt_DAIC_187 uh
376_utt_DAIC_188 i still was a heck of a lot happier
376_utt_DAIC_189 than i am now
376_utt_DAIC_190 so
376_utt_DAIC_191 okay_confirm (okay)
376_utt_DAIC_192 happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
376_utt_DAIC_193 um
376_utt_DAIC_194 uh <sigh>

376_utt_DAIC_198 so
376_utt_DAIC_199 um
376_utt_DAIC_200 and that was difficult as well
376_utt_DAIC_201 sorry_hear (i'm sorry to hear that)

379_utt_DAIC_80 but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me
379_utt_DAIC_81 so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but
379_utt_DAIC_82 you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know
379_utt_DAIC_83 kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories
379_utt_DAIC_84 yeah2 (yeah)
379_utt_DAIC_85 yeah2 (yeah)
379_utt_DAIC_86 i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so

379_utt_DAIC_99 um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but
379_utt_DAIC_100 for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so
379_utt_DAIC_101 things are uh you know
379_utt_DAIC_102 getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well

379_utt_DAIC_105 thats_good (that's good)
379_utt_DAIC_106 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
379_utt_DAIC_107 you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle
379_utt_DAIC_108 you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back
379_utt_DAIC_109 other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but
379_utt_DAIC_110 you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before
379_utt_DAIC_111 so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know
379_utt_DAIC_112 i can either be talk very talkative
379_utt_DAIC_113 or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and
379_utt_DAIC_114 mhm (mhm)
379_utt_DAIC_115 so
379_utt_DAIC_116 <clears throat>
379_utt_DAIC_117 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
379_utt_DAIC_118 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
379_utt_DAIC_119 <laughter>
379_utt_DAIC_120 um you know usually um

379_utt_DAIC_123 or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know

379_utt_DAIC_126 mm (mm)
379_utt_DAIC_127 mm (mm)
379_utt_DAIC_128 <clears throat>
379_utt_DAIC_129 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
379_utt_DAIC_130 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
379_utt_DAIC_131 you know i've actually been better with that
379_utt_DAIC_132 um couple years back you know i
379_utt_DAIC_133 there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just
379_utt_DAIC_134 pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but
379_utt_DAIC_135 you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing
379_utt_DAIC_136 and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat>
379_utt_DAIC_137 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
379_utt_DAIC_138 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
379_utt_DAIC_139 well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but
379_utt_DAIC_140 you know it's it's always something so miniscule that
379_utt_DAIC_141 that's why i probably don't remember it
379_utt_DAIC_142 but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that
379_utt_DAIC_143 you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances
379_utt_DAIC_144 uh_huh (uh huh)
379_utt_DAIC_145 <clears throat>
379_utt_DAIC_146 yeah
379_utt_DAIC_147 feelguilty (what's something you feel guilty about)
379_utt_DAIC_148 something that i feel guilty about
379_utt_DAIC_149 um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing
379_utt_DAIC_150 but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice
379_utt_DAIC_151 <clears throat>
379_utt_DAIC_152 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
379_utt_DAIC_153 hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent
379_utt_DAIC_154 kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got
379_utt_DAIC_155 diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough
379_utt_DAIC_156 and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be
379_utt_DAIC_157 so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies
379_utt_DAIC_158 he could be a little you know
379_utt_DAIC_159 crazy
379_utt_DAIC_160 so
379_utt_DAIC_161 probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah
379_utt_DAIC_162 <clears throat>
379_utt_DAIC_163 yeah_downer (yeah)
379_utt_DAIC_164 been_hard (that sounds really hard)
379_utt_DAIC_165 yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back
379_utt_DAIC_166 been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old
379_utt_DAIC_167 aw (aw)
379_utt_DAIC_168 so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to
379_utt_DAIC_169 i don't i don't  you know
379_utt_DAIC_170 try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah
379_utt_DAIC_171 <clears throat>
379_utt_DAIC_172 downer (okay)
379_utt_DAIC_173 downer (okay)
379_utt_DAIC_174 BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
379_utt_DAIC_175 my best friend
379_utt_DAIC_176 <laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy
379_utt_DAIC_177 usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too
379_utt_DAIC_178 um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny
379_utt_DAIC_179 um i like to hang out you know just
379_utt_DAIC_180 kinda
379_utt_DAIC_181 do things here and there you know just
379_utt_DAIC_182 normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah
379_utt_DAIC_183 mhm (mhm)
379_utt_DAIC_184 <clears throat
379_utt_DAIC_185 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)

379_utt_DAIC_224 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
379_utt_DAIC_225 i felt great you know it
379_utt_DAIC_226 because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything
379_utt_DAIC_227 can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like
379_utt_DAIC_228 that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so

379_utt_DAIC_234 um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about
379_utt_DAIC_235 three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time
379_utt_DAIC_236 you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances
379_utt_DAIC_237 that took place
379_utt_DAIC_238 so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it
379_utt_DAIC_239 but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said
379_utt_DAIC_240 it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way
379_utt_DAIC_241 <clears throat>
379_utt_DAIC_242 yeah3 (yeah)

379_utt_DAIC_248 i would've listened then who knows but you know i probably would've told myself you know just
379_utt_DAIC_249 be careful you know
379_utt_DAIC_250 make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be
379_utt_DAIC_251 um

379_utt_DAIC_272 um
379_utt_DAIC_273 maybe not being as lazy have more determination
379_utt_DAIC_274 i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life
379_utt_DAIC_275 but i know there are times when i i kinda
379_utt_DAIC_276 get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so
379_utt_DAIC_277 mhm (mhm)
379_utt_DAIC_278 <clears throat>
379_utt_DAIC_279 feelbadly (tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself)
379_utt_DAIC_280 um well you know it's it's tough to think back
379_utt_DAIC_281 but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know
379_utt_DAIC_282 i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have
379_utt_DAIC_283 i was trying to give more constructive criticism but
379_utt_DAIC_284 at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and
379_utt_DAIC_285 they were out of character so
379_utt_DAIC_286 <clears throat>

380_utt_DAIC_49 i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing

380_utt_DAIC_65 but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole
380_utt_DAIC_66 like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally
380_utt_DAIC_67 it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um
380_utt_DAIC_68 unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so
380_utt_DAIC_69 so um
380_utt_DAIC_70 uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal

380_utt_DAIC_72 memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences)
380_utt_DAIC_73 hmm

380_utt_DAIC_76 <makes clicking sound with mouth>
380_utt_DAIC_77 i uh
380_utt_DAIC_78 hmm
380_utt_DAIC_79 you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that
380_utt_DAIC_80 yes (yes)
380_utt_DAIC_81 yeah
380_utt_DAIC_82 come back to it
380_utt_DAIC_83 back_later (let's come back to that later)
380_utt_DAIC_84 yeah
380_utt_DAIC_85 that's what i just said
380_utt_DAIC_86 study (what did you study at school)
380_utt_DAIC_87 film
380_utt_DAIC_88 hard_decision (how did you decide to do that)
380_utt_DAIC_89 you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know
380_utt_DAIC_90 i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys
380_utt_DAIC_91 and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls
380_utt_DAIC_92 um
380_utt_DAIC_93 and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and
380_utt_DAIC_94 at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um
380_utt_DAIC_95 like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in
380_utt_DAIC_96 playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film
380_utt_DAIC_97 like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always
380_utt_DAIC_98 i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like
380_utt_DAIC_99 hmm1 (hmm)
380_utt_DAIC_100 um
380_utt_DAIC_101 and uh and i never
380_utt_DAIC_102 uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was
380_utt_DAIC_103 fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars
380_utt_DAIC_104 the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck
380_utt_DAIC_105 uh_huh (uh huh)
380_utt_DAIC_106 and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so
380_utt_DAIC_107 wild_laughter5 ((laughter))
380_utt_DAIC_108 i'm not really sure uh
380_utt_DAIC_109 yeah it's it's it's
380_utt_DAIC_110 um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film
380_utt_DAIC_111 but
380_utt_DAIC_112 uh i've always been fascinated by like
380_utt_DAIC_113 how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general
380_utt_DAIC_114 still_working_on_X (are you still working in that)
380_utt_DAIC_115 i am yes
380_utt_DAIC_116 job_virtually (i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job)
380_utt_DAIC_117 um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct
380_utt_DAIC_118 and uh put <pu> put together
380_utt_DAIC_119 and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make
380_utt_DAIC_120 movies
380_utt_DAIC_121 uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the
380_utt_DAIC_122 all the processes but
380_utt_DAIC_123 mm (mm)
380_utt_DAIC_124 i guess the best parabole for that would be a director
380_utt_DAIC_125 directing
380_utt_DAIC_126 okay_confirm (okay)
380_utt_DAIC_127 family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
380_utt_DAIC_128 well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them
380_utt_DAIC_129 um
380_utt_DAIC_130 my
380_utt_DAIC_131 i guess um
380_utt_DAIC_132 it's funny you should ask ellie um
380_utt_DAIC_133 i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't
380_utt_DAIC_134 when away
380_utt_DAIC_135 like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like
380_utt_DAIC_136 i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like
380_utt_DAIC_137 of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like
380_utt_DAIC_138 um thinks positively about me
380_utt_DAIC_139 um so it's i have like a
380_utt_DAIC_140 a complicated relationship with my parents
380_utt_DAIC_141 i mean <mea> and my family in general
380_utt_DAIC_142 mhm (mhm)
380_utt_DAIC_143 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
380_utt_DAIC_144 well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like
380_utt_DAIC_145 um
380_utt_DAIC_146 i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um
380_utt_DAIC_147 why2 (why)
380_utt_DAIC_148 i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like
380_utt_DAIC_149 uh
380_utt_DAIC_150 or inhibited person maybe um
380_utt_DAIC_151 so i like to like
380_utt_DAIC_152 until

380_utt_DAIC_161 if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like
380_utt_DAIC_162 then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might
380_utt_DAIC_163 go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like
380_utt_DAIC_164 you know competitive sports and hiking
380_utt_DAIC_165 yeah3 (yeah)
380_utt_DAIC_166 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
380_utt_DAIC_167 pretty good
380_utt_DAIC_168 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
380_utt_DAIC_169 well i always like arguing um
380_utt_DAIC_170 i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper
380_utt_DAIC_171 um
380_utt_DAIC_172 i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um
380_utt_DAIC_173 but i don't
380_utt_DAIC_174 as long as my like
380_utt_DAIC_175 'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks
380_utt_DAIC_176 uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject
380_utt_DAIC_177 uh_huh (uh huh)
380_utt_DAIC_178 um
380_utt_DAIC_179 and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think
380_utt_DAIC_180 um
380_utt_DAIC_181 one of my weaker points i would say
380_utt_DAIC_182 but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question
380_utt_DAIC_183 yes (yes)
380_utt_DAIC_184 um
380_utt_DAIC_185 bouts_symptoms (when was the last time that happened)
380_utt_DAIC_186 what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate
380_utt_DAIC_187 uh_huh (uh huh)
380_utt_DAIC_188 hmm
380_utt_DAIC_189 the last time i had a heated debate
380_utt_DAIC_190 was um i had a heated debate about
380_utt_DAIC_191 uh the movie boogie nights
380_utt_DAIC_192 um
380_utt_DAIC_193 i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about
380_utt_DAIC_194 'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the
380_utt_DAIC_195 like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie
380_utt_DAIC_196 why2 (why)
380_utt_DAIC_197 yes (yes)
380_utt_DAIC_198 um
380_utt_DAIC_199 they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um
380_utt_DAIC_200 they have a certain uh they think that the
380_utt_DAIC_201 like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like
380_utt_DAIC_202 complexity of character within the movie
380_utt_DAIC_203 and um
380_utt_DAIC_204 that somehow like
380_utt_DAIC_205 <sigh> um
380_utt_DAIC_206 what what were they saying they were saying like the movie
380_utt_DAIC_207 it like xxx it's like the end of an era
380_utt_DAIC_208 which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they
380_utt_DAIC_209 how they interact in the plot
380_utt_DAIC_210 um
380_utt_DAIC_211 kind of like
380_utt_DAIC_212 uh
380_utt_DAIC_213 yeah i guess
380_utt_DAIC_214 i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's
380_utt_DAIC_215 the um
380_utt_DAIC_216 i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i
380_utt_DAIC_217 i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
380_utt_DAIC_218 mm (mm)
380_utt_DAIC_219 in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it
380_utt_DAIC_220 um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool
380_utt_DAIC_221 um
380_utt_DAIC_222 the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but
380_utt_DAIC_223 but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
380_utt_DAIC_224 yeah2 (yeah)
380_utt_DAIC_225 and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie
380_utt_DAIC_226 and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like
380_utt_DAIC_227 so in the movie django unchained
380_utt_DAIC_228 um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big
380_utt_DAIC_229 the
380_utt_DAIC_230 big purpose of the movie is
380_utt_DAIC_231 right2 (right)
380_utt_DAIC_232 and um
380_utt_DAIC_233 and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh
380_utt_DAIC_234 who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he
380_utt_DAIC_235 was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django
380_utt_DAIC_236 or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera
380_utt_DAIC_237 and um
380_utt_DAIC_238 and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not
380_utt_DAIC_239 sacrifice themself for someone else
380_utt_DAIC_240 hmmB (hmm)
380_utt_DAIC_241 um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like
380_utt_DAIC_242 um
380_utt_DAIC_243 like who
380_utt_DAIC_244 uh like
380_utt_DAIC_245 she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that
380_utt_DAIC_246 altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist
380_utt_DAIC_247 um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself
380_utt_DAIC_248 um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like
380_utt_DAIC_249 every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor
380_utt_DAIC_250 yeah3 (yeah)
380_utt_DAIC_251 in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um
380_utt_DAIC_252 purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate
380_utt_DAIC_253 um
380_utt_DAIC_254 and uh
380_utt_DAIC_255 somewhat like yeah and it's it uh
380_utt_DAIC_256 so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um
380_utt_DAIC_257 i think of losing my temper as being more
380_utt_DAIC_258 um
380_utt_DAIC_259 like i just
380_utt_DAIC_260 so <s> i i would so <s>
380_utt_DAIC_261 revert to um ad hominem like attacks
380_utt_DAIC_262 uh but i i didn't like that's not um
380_utt_DAIC_263 maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like
380_utt_DAIC_264 well you're an idiot
380_utt_DAIC_265 you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort
380_utt_DAIC_266 understand (i understand)
380_utt_DAIC_267 yeah i'm glad you understand
380_utt_DAIC_268 <deep breath>
380_utt_DAIC_269 memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
380_utt_DAIC_270 an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments
380_utt_DAIC_271 not
380_utt_DAIC_272 stories um
380_utt_DAIC_273 like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so
380_utt_DAIC_274 hmmB (hmm)
380_utt_DAIC_275 yeah
380_utt_DAIC_276 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
380_utt_DAIC_277 the hardest decision i've ever had to make
380_utt_DAIC_278 oh geez
380_utt_DAIC_279 could it just be one of the hardest decisions
380_utt_DAIC_280 yeah3 (yeah)
380_utt_DAIC_281 hmm
380_utt_DAIC_282 um
380_utt_DAIC_283 like choosing between two things that it's like
380_utt_DAIC_284 i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between
380_utt_DAIC_285 two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life
380_utt_DAIC_286 but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um
380_utt_DAIC_287 mhm (mhm)
380_utt_DAIC_288 and uh but i had to do it
380_utt_DAIC_289 for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends
380_utt_DAIC_290 were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world
380_utt_DAIC_291 and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't
380_utt_DAIC_292 i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think
380_utt_DAIC_293 it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back
380_utt_DAIC_294 to new york within like a month or two
380_utt_DAIC_295 uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could
380_utt_DAIC_296 leave new york
380_utt_DAIC_297 isee_downer (i see)
380_utt_DAIC_298 difficult (how hard is that)
380_utt_DAIC_299 it was how hard was that
380_utt_DAIC_300 or how hard is
380_utt_DAIC_301 yes (yes)
380_utt_DAIC_302 how hard was that
380_utt_DAIC_303 um
380_utt_DAIC_304 it was hard
380_utt_DAIC_305 <laughter> um
380_utt_DAIC_306 it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like
380_utt_DAIC_307 isolating isolating <is>
380_utt_DAIC_308 'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends
380_utt_DAIC_309 and uh
380_utt_DAIC_310 that had kind of gone extremely
380_utt_DAIC_311 badly
380_utt_DAIC_312 and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole
380_utt_DAIC_313 everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of
380_utt_DAIC_314 saw it at the time so i didn't like
380_utt_DAIC_315 you know just being socially isolated etcetera
380_utt_DAIC_316 yeah_downer (yeah)
380_utt_DAIC_317 that_sucks (that sucks)
380_utt_DAIC_318 yeah
380_utt_DAIC_319 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
380_utt_DAIC_320 well recently it's been awful
380_utt_DAIC_321 um
380_utt_DAIC_322 i uh
380_utt_DAIC_323 i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours
380_utt_DAIC_324 um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams
380_utt_DAIC_325 but previous to that night
380_utt_DAIC_326 so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep
380_utt_DAIC_327 um because i was working on set and i would get back
380_utt_DAIC_328 and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um
380_utt_DAIC_329 too much riled up energy or something i i don't know
380_utt_DAIC_330 mm (mm)
380_utt_DAIC_331 sleep_affects (what are you like when you don't sleep well)
380_utt_DAIC_332 tired uh
380_utt_DAIC_333 very
380_utt_DAIC_334 not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning
380_utt_DAIC_335 and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so
380_utt_DAIC_336 um
380_utt_DAIC_337 i guess
380_utt_DAIC_338 with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go
380_utt_DAIC_339 um without caffeine it's
380_utt_DAIC_340 i'm just i'm just quieter i guess
380_utt_DAIC_341 okay_confirm (okay)
380_utt_DAIC_342 more introverted
380_utt_DAIC_343 behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately)
380_utt_DAIC_344 since
380_utt_DAIC_345 like lately as in when
380_utt_DAIC_346 mind (whatever comes to your mind)
380_utt_DAIC_347 um
380_utt_DAIC_348 change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like
380_utt_DAIC_349 eh at the beginning where the
380_utt_DAIC_350 the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends
380_utt_DAIC_351 and the the push to
380_utt_DAIC_352 to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um
380_utt_DAIC_353 overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like
380_utt_DAIC_354 coming to terms with that um
380_utt_DAIC_355 and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just
380_utt_DAIC_356 you know
380_utt_DAIC_357 you you know <sigh> you know <sigh>
380_utt_DAIC_358 Ellie17Dec2012_03 (that's good)
380_utt_DAIC_359 ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d)
380_utt_DAIC_360 no i just
380_utt_DAIC_361 depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression)
380_utt_DAIC_362 nope
380_utt_DAIC_363 happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
380_utt_DAIC_364 the last time i felt really happy
380_utt_DAIC_365 might have to reach back
380_utt_DAIC_366 um
380_utt_DAIC_367 i think the last time i felt really happy
380_utt_DAIC_368 was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie
380_utt_DAIC_369 um co-wrote co-directed co-produced
380_utt_DAIC_370 um
380_utt_DAIC_371 and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the
380_utt_DAIC_372 writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up
380_utt_DAIC_373 eat breakfast
380_utt_DAIC_374 bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative
380_utt_DAIC_375 full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and
380_utt_DAIC_376 and there's like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like
380_utt_DAIC_377 just like
380_utt_DAIC_378 i felt like it yeah i guess that was the
380_utt_DAIC_379 the last time that was that was like
380_utt_DAIC_380 eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like
380_utt_DAIC_381 wow (wow)
380_utt_DAIC_382 you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like xxx like can't
380_utt_DAIC_383 uh_huh (uh huh)
380_utt_DAIC_384 it's too much else to do so
380_utt_DAIC_385 makes_sense (that makes sense)
380_utt_DAIC_386 Ellie17Dec2012_07 (what would you say are some of your best qualities)
380_utt_DAIC_387 i would say that i'm very
380_utt_DAIC_388 accepting <acce> like

380_utt_DAIC_400 uh
380_utt_DAIC_401 less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my
380_utt_DAIC_402 you know
380_utt_DAIC_403 everyday interactions and in my like
380_utt_DAIC_404 um
380_utt_DAIC_405 you know
380_utt_DAIC_406 zest for for living

380_utt_DAIC_412 feelbadly (tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself)
380_utt_DAIC_413 hmm
380_utt_DAIC_414 really badly about myself
380_utt_DAIC_415 um
380_utt_DAIC_416 <sigh>
380_utt_DAIC_417 i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like
380_utt_DAIC_418 uh
380_utt_DAIC_419 like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um
380_utt_DAIC_420 some sort of uh
380_utt_DAIC_421 conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always
380_utt_DAIC_422 always on the other side of the court you know like never
380_utt_DAIC_423 it was i i noticed
380_utt_DAIC_424 or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were
380_utt_DAIC_425 like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with
380_utt_DAIC_426 like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which
380_utt_DAIC_427 um i was like blamed or like you know
380_utt_DAIC_428 it was my it was my fault um when
380_utt_DAIC_429 when what i was doing like
380_utt_DAIC_430 yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like

380_utt_DAIC_437 i have a tendency to
380_utt_DAIC_438 like i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes
380_utt_DAIC_439 um
380_utt_DAIC_440 ideas are too easily xxx i would just say like do as much as possible like don't
380_utt_DAIC_441 don't decide that you um
380_utt_DAIC_442 are only going to do
380_utt_DAIC_443 one thing um try to like i guess i would've taken up like some done <do> taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums
380_utt_DAIC_444 mhm (mhm)
380_utt_DAIC_445 would've been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes
380_utt_DAIC_446 um
380_utt_DAIC_447 as far as like 'cause i was always really into directing so i was always directing actors and stuff but i didn't

383_utt_DAIC_162 you know not all
383_utt_DAIC_163 nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of the beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little
383_utt_DAIC_164 uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be and
383_utt_DAIC_165 i thought it was funny but yeah it ended up uh me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended up
383_utt_DAIC_166 yeah with us separating but that's something i wish uh

383_utt_DAIC_169 the hardest decision
383_utt_DAIC_170 huh

383_utt_DAIC_180 yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tution hikes going around and um
383_utt_DAIC_181 but another reason why i
383_utt_DAIC_182 decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was
383_utt_DAIC_183  also because um art institute you know um that's a
383_utt_DAIC_184 that's a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician

386_utt_DAIC_19 why2 (why)
386_utt_DAIC_20 well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so

386_utt_DAIC_26 it's um it's very pretty back there natural scenery and
386_utt_DAIC_27 but uh i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with

386_utt_DAIC_30 mhm
386_utt_DAIC_31 why_LA (why did you move to l_a)

386_utt_DAIC_92 i
386_utt_DAIC_93 really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard

386_utt_DAIC_96 since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and

386_utt_DAIC_109 you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with

386_utt_DAIC_125 todays_kids (what do you think of today's kids)
386_utt_DAIC_126 uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many
386_utt_DAIC_127 types of kids out there i think
386_utt_DAIC_128 majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control
386_utt_DAIC_129 but um
386_utt_DAIC_130 i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very
386_utt_DAIC_131 well-behaved so can't say much else about that
386_utt_DAIC_132 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
386_utt_DAIC_133 well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um
386_utt_DAIC_134 uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but
386_utt_DAIC_135 they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes
386_utt_DAIC_136 run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't
386_utt_DAIC_137 oh_no (oh no)
386_utt_DAIC_138 yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting
386_utt_DAIC_139 ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll
386_utt_DAIC_140 kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so
386_utt_DAIC_141 i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter>
386_utt_DAIC_142 but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of
386_utt_DAIC_143 you know
386_utt_DAIC_144 taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's
386_utt_DAIC_145 i can't say anything to her about that
386_utt_DAIC_146 that_sucks (that sucks)
386_utt_DAIC_147 so
386_utt_DAIC_148 yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know
386_utt_DAIC_149 at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but
386_utt_DAIC_150 for now you know that's i'll deal with it so
386_utt_DAIC_151 sleep_affects (what are you like when you don't sleep well)
386_utt_DAIC_152 tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but
386_utt_DAIC_153 the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so
386_utt_DAIC_154 you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep
386_utt_DAIC_155 uh_huh (uh huh)
386_utt_DAIC_156 mhm
386_utt_DAIC_157 feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
386_utt_DAIC_158 uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm
386_utt_DAIC_159 i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean
386_utt_DAIC_160 so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that
386_utt_DAIC_161 right2 (right)
386_utt_DAIC_162 i um
386_utt_DAIC_163 i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know
386_utt_DAIC_164 whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of
386_utt_DAIC_165 creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies
386_utt_DAIC_166 and
386_utt_DAIC_167 you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so

409_utt_DAIC_49 uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um
409_utt_DAIC_50 the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was
409_utt_DAIC_51 i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it
409_utt_DAIC_52 to the degree that i wanted to
409_utt_DAIC_53 dream_job (what's your dream job)
409_utt_DAIC_54 wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh
409_utt_DAIC_55 well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time
409_utt_DAIC_56 this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um
409_utt_DAIC_57 at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing
409_utt_DAIC_58 job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much
409_utt_DAIC_59 too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know
409_utt_DAIC_60 i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel
409_utt_DAIC_61 fulfillment on but i don't wanna
409_utt_DAIC_62 too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice
409_utt_DAIC_63 relaxing job

409_utt_DAIC_69 oh i would say
409_utt_DAIC_70 well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing
409_utt_DAIC_71 um but
409_utt_DAIC_72 i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more
409_utt_DAIC_73 vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much
409_utt_DAIC_74 like once the funny gates open up they kind of
409_utt_DAIC_75 <laughter>
409_utt_DAIC_76 open up too much so i have to like back off you know
409_utt_DAIC_77 wild_laughter5 ((laughter))
409_utt_DAIC_78 but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor
409_utt_DAIC_79 okay_confirm (okay)
409_utt_DAIC_80 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)

409_utt_DAIC_93 i feel safe i can just
409_utt_DAIC_94 dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my
409_utt_DAIC_95 thinking about my own
409_utt_DAIC_96 problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus
409_utt_DAIC_97 on being in the moment with my um
409_utt_DAIC_98 acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances

409_utt_DAIC_104 had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh

409_utt_DAIC_110 um
409_utt_DAIC_111 i'm not sure to be honest um
409_utt_DAIC_112 i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that
409_utt_DAIC_113 it's not really part of my repertoire
409_utt_DAIC_114 um nothing comes to mind off top of my head
409_utt_DAIC_115 okay_confirm (okay)
409_utt_DAIC_116 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
409_utt_DAIC_117 well
409_utt_DAIC_118 um
409_utt_DAIC_119 well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments
409_utt_DAIC_120 back about ten years ago
409_utt_DAIC_121 i was more um
409_utt_DAIC_122 i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people
409_utt_DAIC_123 like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field
409_utt_DAIC_124 and um
409_utt_DAIC_125 i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it
409_utt_DAIC_126 and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity
409_utt_DAIC_127 and um unfortunately i made some bad
409_utt_DAIC_128 financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad
409_utt_DAIC_129 position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up
409_utt_DAIC_130 so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions
409_utt_DAIC_131 that i really regret
409_utt_DAIC_132 isee_downer (i see)
409_utt_DAIC_133 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
409_utt_DAIC_134 wow
409_utt_DAIC_135 hmm
409_utt_DAIC_136 that's a tough one
409_utt_DAIC_137 i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter>
409_utt_DAIC_138 okay_confirm (okay)
409_utt_DAIC_139 okay
409_utt_DAIC_140 family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
409_utt_DAIC_141 oh
409_utt_DAIC_142 well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um
409_utt_DAIC_143 it's just me and my uncle
409_utt_DAIC_144 and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um
409_utt_DAIC_145 he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida
409_utt_DAIC_146 so uh we're we're okay
409_utt_DAIC_147 but um
409_utt_DAIC_148 uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um
409_utt_DAIC_149 we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep
409_utt_DAIC_150 and uh he's got his own problems
409_utt_DAIC_151 so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation
409_utt_DAIC_152 and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have
409_utt_DAIC_153 so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel
409_utt_DAIC_154 i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in
409_utt_DAIC_155 downer (okay)
409_utt_DAIC_156 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
409_utt_DAIC_157 um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem
409_utt_DAIC_158 and um
409_utt_DAIC_159 i have
409_utt_DAIC_160 a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom
409_utt_DAIC_161 and um
409_utt_DAIC_162 so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a
409_utt_DAIC_163 long story short <laughter>
409_utt_DAIC_164 um
409_utt_DAIC_165 it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired
409_utt_DAIC_166 or achy
409_utt_DAIC_167 so it is it is difficult
409_utt_DAIC_168 feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
409_utt_DAIC_169 uh <sigh>
409_utt_DAIC_170 well i've been feeling okay i mean um
409_utt_DAIC_171 i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um
409_utt_DAIC_172 i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't
409_utt_DAIC_173 taken uh responsibility for
409_utt_DAIC_174 but um
409_utt_DAIC_175 i feel a bit of calmness as of late
409_utt_DAIC_176 thats_good (that's good)
409_utt_DAIC_177 ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d)
409_utt_DAIC_178 no
409_utt_DAIC_179 depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression)
409_utt_DAIC_180 well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um
409_utt_DAIC_181 i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h
409_utt_DAIC_182 mhm (mhm)
409_utt_DAIC_183 the minnesota multifaceted
409_utt_DAIC_184 personality something of whether
409_utt_DAIC_185 this is going back about six months ago
409_utt_DAIC_186 they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my
409_utt_DAIC_187 my well being psychologically too and i think some of the
409_utt_DAIC_188 the answers said that they
409_utt_DAIC_189 advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist
409_utt_DAIC_190 i didn't follow that
409_utt_DAIC_191 up on that because
409_utt_DAIC_192 of philosophical differences
409_utt_DAIC_193 but uh i think i might have a you know
409_utt_DAIC_194 a mild case of depression
409_utt_DAIC_195 why2 (why)
409_utt_DAIC_196 well you know um
409_utt_DAIC_197 like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh
409_utt_DAIC_198 i'm doing okay but i you know i
409_utt_DAIC_199 kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my
409_utt_DAIC_200 my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone
409_utt_DAIC_201 i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to
409_utt_DAIC_202 and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh
409_utt_DAIC_203 there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties
409_utt_DAIC_204 so um
409_utt_DAIC_205 you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to
409_utt_DAIC_206 okay_confirm (okay)
409_utt_DAIC_207 happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
409_utt_DAIC_208 wow
409_utt_DAIC_209 that's a good one <laughter>
409_utt_DAIC_210 really happy um
409_utt_DAIC_211 let me think about that a minute
409_utt_DAIC_212 well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth>
409_utt_DAIC_213 okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer
409_utt_DAIC_214 um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow
409_utt_DAIC_215 it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh
409_utt_DAIC_216 we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters
409_utt_DAIC_217 giving out really nice samples
409_utt_DAIC_218 it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a
409_utt_DAIC_219 and um
409_utt_DAIC_220 you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like
409_utt_DAIC_221 have me experience their product or service
409_utt_DAIC_222 and um
409_utt_DAIC_223 i was around people that
409_utt_DAIC_224 i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh
409_utt_DAIC_225 i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh
409_utt_DAIC_226 about a month ago
409_utt_DAIC_227 great_situation (that sounds like a great situation)
409_utt_DAIC_228 yeah
409_utt_DAIC_229 yeah it was
409_utt_DAIC_230 BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
409_utt_DAIC_231 best friend
409_utt_DAIC_232 i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh
409_utt_DAIC_233 i would say um
409_utt_DAIC_234 hmm
409_utt_DAIC_235 i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh
409_utt_DAIC_236 i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter>
409_utt_DAIC_237 Ellie17Dec2012_07 (what would you say are some of your best qualities)
409_utt_DAIC_238 um
409_utt_DAIC_239 i i like to be conscientious i
409_utt_DAIC_240 you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall
409_utt_DAIC_241 i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know
409_utt_DAIC_242 say little white lies or you know
409_utt_DAIC_243 i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic
409_utt_DAIC_244 um
409_utt_DAIC_245 i tend to be
409_utt_DAIC_246 pretty calm for the most part
409_utt_DAIC_247 mhm (mhm)
409_utt_DAIC_248 regret (is there anything you regret)
409_utt_DAIC_249 um
409_utt_DAIC_250 what do i regret
409_utt_DAIC_251 well can you elaborate that <laughter>
409_utt_DAIC_252 mind (whatever comes to your mind)
409_utt_DAIC_253 uh well um
409_utt_DAIC_254 i just well just overall um
409_utt_DAIC_255 i regret uh
409_utt_DAIC_256 not being a little more assertive in in my earlier
409_utt_DAIC_257 uh earlier life um
409_utt_DAIC_258 and kinda put myself in this position
409_utt_DAIC_259 it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life
409_utt_DAIC_260 i made some bad decisions and unfortunately
409_utt_DAIC_261 i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like
409_utt_DAIC_262 sort of like
409_utt_DAIC_263 living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing
409_utt_DAIC_264 so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all
409_utt_DAIC_265 mm (mm)
409_utt_DAIC_266 advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
409_utt_DAIC_267 well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um
409_utt_DAIC_268 i think
409_utt_DAIC_269 i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice
409_utt_DAIC_270 i was kinda going away from
409_utt_DAIC_271 my basic
409_utt_DAIC_272 beingness you know like the way i really felt
409_utt_DAIC_273 like for example i'd make i would do aggressive
409_utt_DAIC_274 uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been
409_utt_DAIC_275 well off for the rest of my life <laughter>
409_utt_DAIC_276 yeah2 (yeah)
409_utt_DAIC_277 but unfortunately it went the opposite way
409_utt_DAIC_278 too too many eggs in that basket
409_utt_DAIC_279 so i kinda regretted going with
409_utt_DAIC_280 my gut feeling and and let other people influence me
409_utt_DAIC_281 and uh
409_utt_DAIC_282 'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments
409_utt_DAIC_283 in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some
409_utt_DAIC_284 aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much
409_utt_DAIC_285 kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret
409_utt_DAIC_286 right2 (right)
409_utt_DAIC_287 yeah
409_utt_DAIC_288 ideal_weekendC (tell me how you spend your ideal weekend)
409_utt_DAIC_289 wow
409_utt_DAIC_290 that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter>
409_utt_DAIC_291 <laughter> well
409_utt_DAIC_292 i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually
409_utt_DAIC_293 you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows
409_utt_DAIC_294 but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um
409_utt_DAIC_295 you know i'd like to
409_utt_DAIC_296 go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game
409_utt_DAIC_297 uh go to a movie
409_utt_DAIC_298 go out with some friends
409_utt_DAIC_299 so i would just or you know just kinda kick back
409_utt_DAIC_300 but my main primary <prima> primary focus would be on
409_utt_DAIC_301 you know earning earning money on the weekends
409_utt_DAIC_302 mhm (mhm)
409_utt_DAIC_303 Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)

409_utt_DAIC_306 most proud of

416_utt_DAIC_71 worn out run down so
416_utt_DAIC_72 something nice something different something creative
416_utt_DAIC_73 something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd

416_utt_DAIC_85 good idea
416_utt_DAIC_86 um a lot of times i
416_utt_DAIC_87 try to just
416_utt_DAIC_88 lay back and you know do some deep breathing
416_utt_DAIC_89 just kind of clear your mind
416_utt_DAIC_90 or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book

416_utt_DAIC_103 um
416_utt_DAIC_104 we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and
416_utt_DAIC_105 wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so
416_utt_DAIC_106 i don't know that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate

416_utt_DAIC_108 frustrated
416_utt_DAIC_109 yeah_downer (yeah)
416_utt_DAIC_110 like
416_utt_DAIC_111 yeah i guess
416_utt_DAIC_112 everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that
416_utt_DAIC_113 you know
416_utt_DAIC_114 of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kinda looking out for themselves
416_utt_DAIC_115 uh_huh (uh huh)

416_utt_DAIC_119 um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know
416_utt_DAIC_120 or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh
416_utt_DAIC_121 you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or
416_utt_DAIC_122 that type of thing

419_utt_DAIC_81 um
419_utt_DAIC_82 i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad um very easily
419_utt_DAIC_83 and sometimes as an adult i still get angry
419_utt_DAIC_84 easily but i've gotten a lot better at
419_utt_DAIC_85 trying to think about things first before saying them and
419_utt_DAIC_86 not having outbursts
419_utt_DAIC_87 things like that
419_utt_DAIC_88 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
419_utt_DAIC_89 um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend
419_utt_DAIC_90 and she actually she has kids i don't
419_utt_DAIC_91 and for some reason she thought
419_utt_DAIC_92 or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and
419_utt_DAIC_93 she didn't and she's home with kids and you know i'm able to do more things
419_utt_DAIC_94 um i don't think i've ever made her feel that
419_utt_DAIC_95 i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it

419_utt_DAIC_97 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
419_utt_DAIC_98 um

419_utt_DAIC_100 when she was talking to me she was very upset and
419_utt_DAIC_101 i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her
419_utt_DAIC_102 but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling
419_utt_DAIC_103 match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and
419_utt_DAIC_104 maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument
419_utt_DAIC_105 hmm_downer (hmm)
419_utt_DAIC_106 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
419_utt_DAIC_107 um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation
419_utt_DAIC_108 i felt that maybe i could've just let her
419_utt_DAIC_109 let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly
419_utt_DAIC_110 um instead of yelling at her too

419_utt_DAIC_116 um
419_utt_DAIC_117 although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was
419_utt_DAIC_118 kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and
419_utt_DAIC_119 i kinda felt by ending the relationship um
419_utt_DAIC_120 i would've wasted those last seven years of my life
419_utt_DAIC_121 it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did
419_utt_DAIC_122 because then i went on to meet um
419_utt_DAIC_123 my husband
419_utt_DAIC_124 aw (aw)

419_utt_DAIC_133 club
419_utt_DAIC_134 and they met some guys and um they invited us back to their place
419_utt_DAIC_135 and i really didn't wanna go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it
419_utt_DAIC_136 but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them
419_utt_DAIC_137 and
419_utt_DAIC_138 back at their house um
419_utt_DAIC_139 one of the guys
419_utt_DAIC_140 actually pulled me into a room and
419_utt_DAIC_141 tried
419_utt_DAIC_142 i i got scared i yelled
419_utt_DAIC_143 he tried to choke me and i thought
419_utt_DAIC_144 i was gonna die right right there i thought he was gonna kill me
419_utt_DAIC_145 but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left
419_utt_DAIC_146 so

426_utt_DAIC_90 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)

426_utt_DAIC_95 by the other person when you're in a relationship

426_utt_DAIC_103 i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation
426_utt_DAIC_104 with an inmate
426_utt_DAIC_105 when i was incarcerated
426_utt_DAIC_106 and that
426_utt_DAIC_107 made me
426_utt_DAIC_108 that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time
426_utt_DAIC_109 and um
426_utt_DAIC_110 if i handled it differently
426_utt_DAIC_111 i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner

426_utt_DAIC_113 happen yeah

426_utt_DAIC_123 and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life
426_utt_DAIC_124 i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory
426_utt_DAIC_125 along with the good memories as well
426_utt_DAIC_126 um
426_utt_DAIC_127 a few you few

426_utt_DAIC_131 you know those things i think those inhibit me
426_utt_DAIC_132 i guess to to explore
426_utt_DAIC_133 certain areas of life that i'm not
426_utt_DAIC_134 comfortable with so those are the feww things that

426_utt_DAIC_148 family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)

426_utt_DAIC_166 um
426_utt_DAIC_167 she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up

426_utt_DAIC_170 and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well

444_utt_DAIC_86 so that's what i wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher

444_utt_DAIC_88 and being a professor of ethics
444_utt_DAIC_89 um but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how i
444_utt_DAIC_90 ended up joining the peace corps <laughter> so it all worked out

444_utt_DAIC_135 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
444_utt_DAIC_136 <sigh> i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i um i tend to have outbursts
444_utt_DAIC_137 every once in a while
444_utt_DAIC_138 um when things are getting too chaotic
444_utt_DAIC_139 at my house um
444_utt_DAIC_140 and i'm feeling very underappreciated
444_utt_DAIC_141 i will
444_utt_DAIC_142 have a
444_utt_DAIC_143 burst of anger
444_utt_DAIC_144 landed_trouble (has that gotten you in trouble)
444_utt_DAIC_145 yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation
444_utt_DAIC_146 but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of
444_utt_DAIC_147 um recognizing that i'm upset about it
444_utt_DAIC_148 my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad
444_utt_DAIC_149 and then that escalates and
444_utt_DAIC_150 uh
444_utt_DAIC_151 sometimes i just end up walking out the door
444_utt_DAIC_152 or going to my room
444_utt_DAIC_153 symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
444_utt_DAIC_154 hmm
444_utt_DAIC_155 i'm sorry
444_utt_DAIC_156 symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
444_utt_DAIC_157 um i i usually after i have an outburst
444_utt_DAIC_158 and i isolate myself for a little bit
444_utt_DAIC_159 i can come back relaxed
444_utt_DAIC_160 and deal with the situation
444_utt_DAIC_161 in a
444_utt_DAIC_162 more
444_utt_DAIC_163 calm manner
444_utt_DAIC_164 difficult (how hard is that)
444_utt_DAIC_165 um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to
444_utt_DAIC_166 stop and and get myself out of there
444_utt_DAIC_167 and and go take some deep breaths
444_utt_DAIC_168 um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling
444_utt_DAIC_169 mhm (mhm)
444_utt_DAIC_170 why i'm being angry why why am i being
444_utt_DAIC_171 um
444_utt_DAIC_172 so tense
444_utt_DAIC_173 and then be able to verbalize that
444_utt_DAIC_174 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
444_utt_DAIC_175 um
444_utt_DAIC_176 well i i it happens a few times when i start getting
444_utt_DAIC_177 i've had a very tense day
444_utt_DAIC_178 um and things haven't gone right
444_utt_DAIC_179 um
444_utt_DAIC_180 i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm  making dinner
444_utt_DAIC_181 and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework
444_utt_DAIC_182 or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh
444_utt_DAIC_183 uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then
444_utt_DAIC_184 and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out
444_utt_DAIC_185 just let me finish dinner
444_utt_DAIC_186 and nobody would
444_utt_DAIC_187 and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up
444_utt_DAIC_188 and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to
444_utt_DAIC_189 pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there
444_utt_DAIC_190 wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
444_utt_DAIC_191 um so that that i i should have um
444_utt_DAIC_192 walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that
444_utt_DAIC_193 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
444_utt_DAIC_194 um
444_utt_DAIC_195 it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child
444_utt_DAIC_196 um i wasn't married
444_utt_DAIC_197 um <tisk> i had a very good friend
444_utt_DAIC_198 um
444_utt_DAIC_199 oh i was i was
444_utt_DAIC_200 thirty two at the time
444_utt_DAIC_201 so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion
444_utt_DAIC_202 but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this
444_utt_DAIC_203 um
444_utt_DAIC_204 and i had
444_utt_DAIC_205 um
444_utt_DAIC_206 i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to
444_utt_DAIC_207 um
444_utt_DAIC_208 but we'd only been dating like three months
444_utt_DAIC_209 and i was living with
444_utt_DAIC_210 a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with
444_utt_DAIC_211 um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well
444_utt_DAIC_212 um i didn't know if we could raise a child together
444_utt_DAIC_213 i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else
444_utt_DAIC_214 um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together
444_utt_DAIC_215 um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together
444_utt_DAIC_216 aw (aw)
444_utt_DAIC_217 um
444_utt_DAIC_218 and uh so it was a lot of
444_utt_DAIC_219 um
444_utt_DAIC_220 huge decisions
444_utt_DAIC_221 that were gonna determine the rest of my life
444_utt_DAIC_222 um
444_utt_DAIC_223 and i
444_utt_DAIC_224 made the decision based on
444_utt_DAIC_225 more common sense and practicality
444_utt_DAIC_226 um
444_utt_DAIC_227 but i don't regret that decision
444_utt_DAIC_228 i think i made a good decision
444_utt_DAIC_229 thats_good (that's good)
444_utt_DAIC_230 to marry my husband and
444_utt_DAIC_231 raise our child <laughter>
444_utt_DAIC_232 yeah3 (yeah)
444_utt_DAIC_233 kids_elaborate (tell me about your kids)
444_utt_DAIC_234 um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen
444_utt_DAIC_235 he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering
444_utt_DAIC_236 he is getting his pilot's license
444_utt_DAIC_237 uh which i'm very proud of him for
444_utt_DAIC_238 um then my daughter is
444_utt_DAIC_239 fifteen
444_utt_DAIC_240 and she loves acting
444_utt_DAIC_241 uh she um she has a boyfriend
444_utt_DAIC_242 who um
444_utt_DAIC_243 uh they see just once a week at church basically
444_utt_DAIC_244 um and they text each other constantly
444_utt_DAIC_245 um she's a very very typical fifteen year old
444_utt_DAIC_246 wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
444_utt_DAIC_247 and then i have a twelve year old
444_utt_DAIC_248 he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly
444_utt_DAIC_249 um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house
444_utt_DAIC_250 so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis
444_utt_DAIC_251 nice (nice)
444_utt_DAIC_252 easy_parent (do you find it easy to be a parent)
444_utt_DAIC_253 no
444_utt_DAIC_254 i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't
444_utt_DAIC_255 my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young
444_utt_DAIC_256 and um my mother kind of disconnected
444_utt_DAIC_257 when that happened
444_utt_DAIC_258 um so i didn't have a very warm or loving
444_utt_DAIC_259 relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was
444_utt_DAIC_260 um kind of on my own from a very young age
444_utt_DAIC_261 um
444_utt_DAIC_262 i mean she was at the house but
444_utt_DAIC_263 really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have
444_utt_DAIC_264 parenting skills
444_utt_DAIC_265 yeah2 (yeah)
444_utt_DAIC_266 that you know most people are are raised with
444_utt_DAIC_267 um
444_utt_DAIC_268 i know what not to do
444_utt_DAIC_269 but sometimes it's very difficult and um
444_utt_DAIC_270 i i see my friends that have you know these
444_utt_DAIC_271 very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect
444_utt_DAIC_272 um and it's like i i'm just not that person
444_utt_DAIC_273 so i i
444_utt_DAIC_274 i try and be
444_utt_DAIC_275 i'm i i think i am a very good mother
444_utt_DAIC_276 but i'm not um
444_utt_DAIC_277 a typical mother
444_utt_DAIC_278 i think i'm more
444_utt_DAIC_279 um i'm more creative
444_utt_DAIC_280 a lot of times i and we do a lot of things
444_utt_DAIC_281 um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing
444_utt_DAIC_282 mhm (mhm)
444_utt_DAIC_283 actually when we go camping it's more
444_utt_DAIC_284 i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home
444_utt_DAIC_285 i think i'm more tense when i'm at home
444_utt_DAIC_286 but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become
444_utt_DAIC_287 calmer and more patient
444_utt_DAIC_288 i think my patience is what
444_utt_DAIC_289 um i need to work on the most
444_utt_DAIC_290 understand (i understand)
444_utt_DAIC_291 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
444_utt_DAIC_292 i'm a been an insomniac all my life
444_utt_DAIC_293 i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and
444_utt_DAIC_294 um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise
444_utt_DAIC_295 and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day
444_utt_DAIC_296 i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired
444_utt_DAIC_297 to sleep well
444_utt_DAIC_298 um and that's sometimes that's hard to do
444_utt_DAIC_299 um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading
444_utt_DAIC_300 i'll read 'til midnight
444_utt_DAIC_301 um and then i'll try and go to sleep
444_utt_DAIC_302 um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again
444_utt_DAIC_303 and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep
444_utt_DAIC_304 feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
444_utt_DAIC_305 yesterday i didn't feel so good i was
444_utt_DAIC_306 um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday
444_utt_DAIC_307 um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden
444_utt_DAIC_308 yeah_downer (yeah)
444_utt_DAIC_309 and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard
444_utt_DAIC_310 um so i had some more planting to do
444_utt_DAIC_311 and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it
444_utt_DAIC_312 um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good
444_utt_DAIC_313 so i feel more positive i feel more energy
444_utt_DAIC_314 thats_good (that's good)
444_utt_DAIC_315 ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d)
444_utt_DAIC_316 so
444_utt_DAIC_317 no
444_utt_DAIC_318 depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression)

444_utt_DAIC_320 happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
444_utt_DAIC_321 um
444_utt_DAIC_322 i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that
444_utt_DAIC_323 hasn't really helped me sleep
444_utt_DAIC_324 but um
444_utt_DAIC_325 it was really good because i needed one for a really long time
444_utt_DAIC_326 and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane
444_utt_DAIC_327 um but it was
444_utt_DAIC_328 you know just like
444_utt_DAIC_329 i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's
444_utt_DAIC_330 it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing
444_utt_DAIC_331 and it was like finally
444_utt_DAIC_332 uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list
444_utt_DAIC_333 um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and
444_utt_DAIC_334 uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy
444_utt_DAIC_335 thats_great (that's great)
444_utt_DAIC_336 BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
444_utt_DAIC_337 <laughter> i don't know um
444_utt_DAIC_338 i think she
444_utt_DAIC_339 believes that i'm
444_utt_DAIC_340 uh
444_utt_DAIC_341 uh
444_utt_DAIC_342 more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am
444_utt_DAIC_343 at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues
444_utt_DAIC_344 uh
444_utt_DAIC_345 she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice
444_utt_DAIC_346 um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me
444_utt_DAIC_347 um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by
444_utt_DAIC_348 uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic
444_utt_DAIC_349 uh_huh (uh huh)
444_utt_DAIC_350 um or empathetic and
444_utt_DAIC_351 uh i just i'm just there to listen
444_utt_DAIC_352 and i don't need to give her any advice so
444_utt_DAIC_353 i think a a good listener and
444_utt_DAIC_354 good advice giver
444_utt_DAIC_355 okay_confirm (okay)
444_utt_DAIC_356 self_change (what are some things you wish you could change about yourself)
444_utt_DAIC_357 i procrastinate a lot
444_utt_DAIC_358 um i start projects and i don't finish them
444_utt_DAIC_359 uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and
444_utt_DAIC_360 um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get
444_utt_DAIC_361 almost finished
444_utt_DAIC_362 and then
444_utt_DAIC_363 i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest
444_utt_DAIC_364 um
444_utt_DAIC_365 sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them
444_utt_DAIC_366 which sounds a little strange but
444_utt_DAIC_367 um
444_utt_DAIC_368 i i'm working on that
444_utt_DAIC_369 i'm trying to get those done
444_utt_DAIC_370 okay_confirm (okay)
444_utt_DAIC_371 regret (is there anything you regret)
444_utt_DAIC_372 oh gosh <laughter> um
444_utt_DAIC_373 not following through on the opportunities i had when
444_utt_DAIC_374 i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree
444_utt_DAIC_375 um
444_utt_DAIC_376 with on a grant and things of that sort um
444_utt_DAIC_377 but instead i got pregnant and got married
444_utt_DAIC_378 and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed
444_utt_DAIC_379 um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time
444_utt_DAIC_380 where i had to fight for a directorship
444_utt_DAIC_381 and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship
444_utt_DAIC_382 and so i really wish so i resigned
444_utt_DAIC_383 um
444_utt_DAIC_384 and i wish i had stuck with that
444_utt_DAIC_385 um
444_utt_DAIC_386 'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and
444_utt_DAIC_387 solid career
444_utt_DAIC_388 yeah_downer (yeah)
444_utt_DAIC_389 advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
444_utt_DAIC_390 um
444_utt_DAIC_391 not
444_utt_DAIC_392 base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses
444_utt_DAIC_393 um the jobs were wonderful
444_utt_DAIC_394 um
444_utt_DAIC_395 but
444_utt_DAIC_396 my ego got in the way
444_utt_DAIC_397 and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the
444_utt_DAIC_398 the
444_utt_DAIC_399 egotistical
444_utt_DAIC_400 reactions that i had
444_utt_DAIC_401 to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well
444_utt_DAIC_402 mhm (mhm)
444_utt_DAIC_403 Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)
444_utt_DAIC_404 um my children actually
444_utt_DAIC_405 um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal
444_utt_DAIC_406 um and
444_utt_DAIC_407 uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that
444_utt_DAIC_408 they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl
444_utt_DAIC_409 my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started
444_utt_DAIC_410 and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day
444_utt_DAIC_411 and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it
444_utt_DAIC_412 um so that's
444_utt_DAIC_413 that was

446_utt_DAIC_147 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
446_utt_DAIC_148 the hardest decision i've ever had to make
446_utt_DAIC_149 well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage
446_utt_DAIC_150 um mother
446_utt_DAIC_151 i was pregnant at sixteen and
446_utt_DAIC_152 um i had um
446_utt_DAIC_153 a lot of pressure from family to um
446_utt_DAIC_154 give my child up for adoption or to
446_utt_DAIC_155 um abort
446_utt_DAIC_156 and i chose life so that was
446_utt_DAIC_157 that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old
446_utt_DAIC_158 teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager
446_utt_DAIC_159 or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so
446_utt_DAIC_160 that i think was the hardest decision
446_utt_DAIC_161 i had to make
446_utt_DAIC_162 symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
446_utt_DAIC_163 um
446_utt_DAIC_164 well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later
446_utt_DAIC_165 and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by
446_utt_DAIC_166 not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life
446_utt_DAIC_167 pro-choice pro-life and um
446_utt_DAIC_168 eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and
446_utt_DAIC_169 i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom
446_utt_DAIC_170 aw (aw)
446_utt_DAIC_171 i do yeah
446_utt_DAIC_172 easy_parent (do you find it easy to be a parent)
446_utt_DAIC_173 um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties
446_utt_DAIC_174 um just as anything
446_utt_DAIC_175 um
446_utt_DAIC_176 but at the end of the day it is really rewarding
446_utt_DAIC_177 um
446_utt_DAIC_178 and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised
446_utt_DAIC_179 become a productive citizen and go out into society and
446_utt_DAIC_180 just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is
446_utt_DAIC_181 parent_differences (what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents)
446_utt_DAIC_182 oh wow
446_utt_DAIC_183 so many ways um
446_utt_DAIC_184 the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um
446_utt_DAIC_185 accept his feedback even if i don't like it
446_utt_DAIC_186 and i um allow him to express his self
446_utt_DAIC_187 fortunately unfortunately when i was little um
446_utt_DAIC_188 there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child
446_utt_DAIC_189 um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it
446_utt_DAIC_190 um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self
446_utt_DAIC_191 i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age
446_utt_DAIC_192 and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um
446_utt_DAIC_193 make sure that you nurture that um because that's
446_utt_DAIC_194 kind of um
446_utt_DAIC_195 the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so

448_utt_DAIC_54 from back then people were different than they
448_utt_DAIC_55 uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it
448_utt_DAIC_56 awesome (awesome)
448_utt_DAIC_57 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
448_utt_DAIC_58 <sigh> well
448_utt_DAIC_59 my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but
448_utt_DAIC_60 uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper
448_utt_DAIC_61 and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about
448_utt_DAIC_62 but um
448_utt_DAIC_63 i'm working on it and
448_utt_DAIC_64 uh
448_utt_DAIC_65 i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child

448_utt_DAIC_67 oh yes <laughter>
448_utt_DAIC_68 tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
448_utt_DAIC_69 uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh
448_utt_DAIC_70 <sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter
448_utt_DAIC_71 but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young
448_utt_DAIC_72 uh follows you for the rest of your life and
448_utt_DAIC_73 i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices
448_utt_DAIC_74 yeah_downer (yeah)
448_utt_DAIC_75 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
448_utt_DAIC_76 uh me and my wife we
448_utt_DAIC_77 we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree
448_utt_DAIC_78 and it's
448_utt_DAIC_79 she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh
448_utt_DAIC_80 uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is
448_utt_DAIC_81 a determined strong willed woman and <sniff>
448_utt_DAIC_82 i am who i am so
448_utt_DAIC_83 we kinda go back and forth and
448_utt_DAIC_84 lately i have been the one to <sigh>
448_utt_DAIC_85 bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run
448_utt_DAIC_86 it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me
448_utt_DAIC_87 yeah_downer (yeah)
448_utt_DAIC_88 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
448_utt_DAIC_89 um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed
448_utt_DAIC_90 and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and
448_utt_DAIC_91 having an ego bigger than my common sense and um
448_utt_DAIC_92 that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh
448_utt_DAIC_93 i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um
448_utt_DAIC_94 getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but
448_utt_DAIC_95 when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and
448_utt_DAIC_96 <sniff>
448_utt_DAIC_97 if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so
448_utt_DAIC_98 i
448_utt_DAIC_99 you know ran where
448_utt_DAIC_100 people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble
448_utt_DAIC_101 uh_huh (uh huh)
448_utt_DAIC_102 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
448_utt_DAIC_103 hardest decision i ever had to make was
448_utt_DAIC_104 giving the authorization to
448_utt_DAIC_105 um
448_utt_DAIC_106 have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed
448_utt_DAIC_107 <sigh> and um
448_utt_DAIC_108 doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him
448_utt_DAIC_109 <sigh> go through any suffering
448_utt_DAIC_110 to
448_utt_DAIC_111 let him slip away
448_utt_DAIC_112 and as you can see i get very upset my uncle
448_utt_DAIC_113 raised me like his own son and
448_utt_DAIC_114 never let me down
448_utt_DAIC_115 <sniff> and he's gone and
448_utt_DAIC_116 for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff>
448_utt_DAIC_117 but as i said i'm getting over it and um
448_utt_DAIC_118 things are getting better slowly
448_utt_DAIC_119 downer (okay)
448_utt_DAIC_120 influence_positive (who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life)
448_utt_DAIC_121 my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself
448_utt_DAIC_122 um <coughs> we enjoy
448_utt_DAIC_123 uh uh doing simple things
448_utt_DAIC_124 it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company
448_utt_DAIC_125 uh we like the same things and uh we
448_utt_DAIC_126 you know occasionally go out and do something together but we
448_utt_DAIC_127 <clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she
448_utt_DAIC_128 like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes

448_utt_DAIC_142 i'll stay up all day and
448_utt_DAIC_143 i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but
448_utt_DAIC_144 you know for me i'm
448_utt_DAIC_145 it doesn't affect me

448_utt_DAIC_275 he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they
448_utt_DAIC_276 um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think
448_utt_DAIC_277 they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems

448_utt_DAIC_279 i wish i could've changed some things um
448_utt_DAIC_280 <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody
448_utt_DAIC_281 and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do
448_utt_DAIC_282 uh i don't miss them but
448_utt_DAIC_283 if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made
448_utt_DAIC_284 Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)
448_utt_DAIC_285 my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff>

448_utt_DAIC_288 well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh

448_utt_DAIC_290 i've been told that
448_utt_DAIC_291 once or twice but i i've kind of
448_utt_DAIC_292 i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but
448_utt_DAIC_293 i just don't feel the motivation no more

449_utt_DAIC_23 go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean
449_utt_DAIC_24 nice (nice)
449_utt_DAIC_25 travel_changed (what do you enjoy about traveling)
449_utt_DAIC_26 the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter>
449_utt_DAIC_27 travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips)
449_utt_DAIC_28 um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from
449_utt_DAIC_29 so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home
449_utt_DAIC_30 so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom
449_utt_DAIC_31 and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way
449_utt_DAIC_32 makes_sense (that makes sense)
449_utt_DAIC_33 memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences)
449_utt_DAIC_34 experiences on vacation or
449_utt_DAIC_35 yeah3 (yeah)
449_utt_DAIC_36 um most memorable experience
449_utt_DAIC_37 probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so
449_utt_DAIC_38 having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause
449_utt_DAIC_39 no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter>
449_utt_DAIC_40 wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
449_utt_DAIC_41 awesome (awesome)
449_utt_DAIC_42 study (what did you study at school)
449_utt_DAIC_43 business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field
449_utt_DAIC_44 so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field
449_utt_DAIC_45 dream_job (what's your dream job)
449_utt_DAIC_46 my dream job
449_utt_DAIC_47 hmm
449_utt_DAIC_48 well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook
449_utt_DAIC_49 and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family
449_utt_DAIC_50 if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now
449_utt_DAIC_51 but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job
449_utt_DAIC_52 yeah3 (yeah)
449_utt_DAIC_53 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
449_utt_DAIC_54 i'm outgoing
449_utt_DAIC_55 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
449_utt_DAIC_56 <laughter>
449_utt_DAIC_57 <laughter> that's cool <laughter>
449_utt_DAIC_58 uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at
449_utt_DAIC_59 and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e
449_utt_DAIC_60 so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation
449_utt_DAIC_61 figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first
449_utt_DAIC_62 mhm (mhm)
449_utt_DAIC_63 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
449_utt_DAIC_64 i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with
449_utt_DAIC_65 um i don't really let anything agitate me
449_utt_DAIC_66 and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just
449_utt_DAIC_67 do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it
449_utt_DAIC_68 be who you are and just stay there
449_utt_DAIC_69 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
449_utt_DAIC_70 actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it
449_utt_DAIC_71 and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways
449_utt_DAIC_72 and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings
449_utt_DAIC_73 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
449_utt_DAIC_74 when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because
449_utt_DAIC_75 the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic
449_utt_DAIC_76 and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard
449_utt_DAIC_77 mm (mm)
449_utt_DAIC_78 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
449_utt_DAIC_79 hmm <sigh> let's see
449_utt_DAIC_80 i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old
449_utt_DAIC_81 and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it
449_utt_DAIC_82 he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him
449_utt_DAIC_83 as opposed to waiting him to call me
449_utt_DAIC_84 and i think
449_utt_DAIC_85 it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come
449_utt_DAIC_86 and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place
449_utt_DAIC_87 but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but
449_utt_DAIC_88 i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult
449_utt_DAIC_89 and then also not expected him to just kinda you know
449_utt_DAIC_90 i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense
449_utt_DAIC_91 uh_huh (uh huh)
449_utt_DAIC_92 easy_parent (do you find it easy to be a parent)
449_utt_DAIC_93 woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and
449_utt_DAIC_94 i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so
449_utt_DAIC_95 it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally
449_utt_DAIC_96 so
449_utt_DAIC_97 my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect
449_utt_DAIC_98 so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect
449_utt_DAIC_99 thats_good (that's good)
449_utt_DAIC_100 parent_hardest (what's the hardest thing about being a parent)
449_utt_DAIC_101 seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change
449_utt_DAIC_102 but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just
449_utt_DAIC_103 kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that
449_utt_DAIC_104 i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own
449_utt_DAIC_105 and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but
449_utt_DAIC_106 whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me
449_utt_DAIC_107 yeah_downer (yeah)
449_utt_DAIC_108 parent_best (what's the best thing about being a parent)
449_utt_DAIC_109 it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real
449_utt_DAIC_110 it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy
449_utt_DAIC_111 um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own
449_utt_DAIC_112 and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just
449_utt_DAIC_113 being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that
449_utt_DAIC_114 parent_differences (what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents)
449_utt_DAIC_115 wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here
449_utt_DAIC_116 so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing
449_utt_DAIC_117 it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure
449_utt_DAIC_118 uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling
449_utt_DAIC_119 but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter
449_utt_DAIC_120 so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent
449_utt_DAIC_121 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
449_utt_DAIC_122 divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me
449_utt_DAIC_123 and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore
449_utt_DAIC_124 and
449_utt_DAIC_125 since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while
449_utt_DAIC_126 um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just
449_utt_DAIC_127 did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of
449_utt_DAIC_128 how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything
449_utt_DAIC_129 physical and and all the material stuff i could care less
449_utt_DAIC_130 but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about
449_utt_DAIC_131 change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
449_utt_DAIC_132 uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that
449_utt_DAIC_133 he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it
449_utt_DAIC_134 bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home
449_utt_DAIC_135 and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through
449_utt_DAIC_136 and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself
449_utt_DAIC_137 in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return
449_utt_DAIC_138 downer (okay)
449_utt_DAIC_139 <laughter>
449_utt_DAIC_140 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
449_utt_DAIC_141 you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day
449_utt_DAIC_142 my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night
449_utt_DAIC_143 i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody
449_utt_DAIC_144 did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma
449_utt_DAIC_145 i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today
449_utt_DAIC_146 and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to
449_utt_DAIC_147 go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day
449_utt_DAIC_148 thats_good (that's good)
449_utt_DAIC_149 feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
449_utt_DAIC_150 really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son
449_utt_DAIC_151 my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance
449_utt_DAIC_152 but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle
449_utt_DAIC_153 that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little
449_utt_DAIC_154 mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not
449_utt_DAIC_155 okay_confirm (okay)
449_utt_DAIC_156 <laughter>
449_utt_DAIC_157 ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d)
449_utt_DAIC_158 no i haven't thank god

449_utt_DAIC_161 happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
449_utt_DAIC_162 really happy let's see
449_utt_DAIC_163 uh it's at home and i think it was when
449_utt_DAIC_164 wow
449_utt_DAIC_165 <mumbling> different things running through my head um
449_utt_DAIC_166 i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on
449_utt_DAIC_167 our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me
449_utt_DAIC_168 and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me
449_utt_DAIC_169 without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself
449_utt_DAIC_170 and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very
449_utt_DAIC_171 tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me
449_utt_DAIC_172 aw (aw)
449_utt_DAIC_173 <laughter>
449_utt_DAIC_174 good_hear (that's so good to hear)
449_utt_DAIC_175 thank you
449_utt_DAIC_176 BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
449_utt_DAIC_177 um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very
449_utt_DAIC_178 you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be
449_utt_DAIC_179 um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do
449_utt_DAIC_180 and i just you know i don't
449_utt_DAIC_181 i don't deal with b s <laughter>
449_utt_DAIC_182 mhm (mhm)
449_utt_DAIC_183 self_change (what are some things you wish you could change about yourself)
449_utt_DAIC_184 hmm what could i change about myself
449_utt_DAIC_185 uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself
449_utt_DAIC_186 um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um
449_utt_DAIC_187 i think i would just be
449_utt_DAIC_188 a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware
449_utt_DAIC_189 make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody
449_utt_DAIC_190 uh_huh (uh huh)
449_utt_DAIC_191 regret (is there anything you regret)
449_utt_DAIC_192 i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me
449_utt_DAIC_193 so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret
449_utt_DAIC_194 because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that
449_utt_DAIC_195 everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it
449_utt_DAIC_196 what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys
449_utt_DAIC_197 understand (i understand)
449_utt_DAIC_198 advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
449_utt_DAIC_199 hmm
449_utt_DAIC_200 be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am
449_utt_DAIC_201 to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure
449_utt_DAIC_202 be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me
449_utt_DAIC_203 don't try to revamp <re>
449_utt_DAIC_204 don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not
449_utt_DAIC_205 uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders
449_utt_DAIC_206 but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it
449_utt_DAIC_207 but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments
449_utt_DAIC_208 Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)
449_utt_DAIC_209 my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what
449_utt_DAIC_210 at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle
449_utt_DAIC_211 that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary
449_utt_DAIC_212 scrubbed_entry
449_utt_DAIC_213 and i'm always just
449_utt_DAIC_214 true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that
449_utt_DAIC_215 i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from
449_utt_DAIC_216 yeah3 (yeah)

455_utt_DAIC_117 to hold guilt about the way anything
455_utt_DAIC_118 uh went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences
455_utt_DAIC_119 uh that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as

455_utt_DAIC_134 um for me decisions don't really come
455_utt_DAIC_135 as difficult to make
455_utt_DAIC_136 they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood

457_utt_DAIC_166 hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she
457_utt_DAIC_167 actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part
457_utt_DAIC_168 where
457_utt_DAIC_169 she is a hundred percent kind and caring
457_utt_DAIC_170 all the time
457_utt_DAIC_171 all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that

464_utt_DAIC_59 uh_huh (uh huh)
464_utt_DAIC_60 okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples
464_utt_DAIC_61 and um it started raining
464_utt_DAIC_62 so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go
464_utt_DAIC_63 the the smaller the steps get
464_utt_DAIC_64 so
464_utt_DAIC_65 like people back then had
464_utt_DAIC_66 uh smaller feet
464_utt_DAIC_67 so what happened was
464_utt_DAIC_68 as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways
464_utt_DAIC_69 so my feet could measure up to the the the steps
464_utt_DAIC_70 but once you get up there it's a nice view
464_utt_DAIC_71 i yeah
464_utt_DAIC_72 awesome (awesome)
464_utt_DAIC_73 study (what did you study at school)
464_utt_DAIC_74 uh general education but

464_utt_DAIC_77 change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
464_utt_DAIC_78 um well
464_utt_DAIC_79 when i was a kid
464_utt_DAIC_80 i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so
464_utt_DAIC_81 i just pursued it
464_utt_DAIC_82 so
464_utt_DAIC_83 yeah
464_utt_DAIC_84 dream_job (what's your dream job)
464_utt_DAIC_85 my dream job
464_utt_DAIC_86 would be to get paid for painting
464_utt_DAIC_87 painting art
464_utt_DAIC_88 wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
464_utt_DAIC_89 yeah
464_utt_DAIC_90 um
464_utt_DAIC_91 yeah
464_utt_DAIC_92 pretty simple
464_utt_DAIC_93 difficult (how hard is that)
464_utt_DAIC_94 um
464_utt_DAIC_95 it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion
464_utt_DAIC_96 um
464_utt_DAIC_97 persistence
464_utt_DAIC_98 and faith and will
464_utt_DAIC_99 you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed
464_utt_DAIC_100 mm (mm)
464_utt_DAIC_101 mhm
464_utt_DAIC_102 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
464_utt_DAIC_103 i consider myself to be shy in certain um
464_utt_DAIC_104 time and places
464_utt_DAIC_105 but i am also out outgoing when
464_utt_DAIC_106 like i have the energy
464_utt_DAIC_107 so
464_utt_DAIC_108 i feel like it's well balanced you know
464_utt_DAIC_109 like i'm shy when it's
464_utt_DAIC_110 i guess
464_utt_DAIC_111 okay to be shy
464_utt_DAIC_112 you know
464_utt_DAIC_113 and i'm outgoing when
464_utt_DAIC_114 like the need to actually
464_utt_DAIC_115 um have fun or just explore
464_utt_DAIC_116 it feels good like
464_utt_DAIC_117 if that makes sense but yeah
464_utt_DAIC_118 understand (i understand)
464_utt_DAIC_119 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
464_utt_DAIC_120 <laughter>
464_utt_DAIC_121 yeah
464_utt_DAIC_122 to uh relax
464_utt_DAIC_123 um
464_utt_DAIC_124 either well i don't know if i should say this but i smoke weed <laughter>
464_utt_DAIC_125 so that helps
464_utt_DAIC_126 and
464_utt_DAIC_127 i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax
464_utt_DAIC_128 you know especially when i use the color blue
464_utt_DAIC_129 because the color blue um relaxes me
464_utt_DAIC_130 and also green
464_utt_DAIC_131 when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms <calm>calms me down
464_utt_DAIC_132 cool3 (cool)
464_utt_DAIC_133 yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah
464_utt_DAIC_134 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
464_utt_DAIC_135 my temper
464_utt_DAIC_136 um well my thoughts
464_utt_DAIC_137 my thoughts control my emotions
464_utt_DAIC_138 and my emotions
464_utt_DAIC_139 yeah that's pretty much how
464_utt_DAIC_140 my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad
464_utt_DAIC_141 or if i do get mad what will be the outcome
464_utt_DAIC_142 you know
464_utt_DAIC_143 so
464_utt_DAIC_144 controlling my temper is just
464_utt_DAIC_145 by training my thought
464_utt_DAIC_146 mm (mm)
464_utt_DAIC_147 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
464_utt_DAIC_148 um <sigh>
464_utt_DAIC_149 the last time i argued with somebody
464_utt_DAIC_150 was with my with my father
464_utt_DAIC_151 and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine
464_utt_DAIC_152 so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no
464_utt_DAIC_153 so that kinda frustrated me
464_utt_DAIC_154 and
464_utt_DAIC_155 the way i handled it was like well
464_utt_DAIC_156 i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so
464_utt_DAIC_157 you know
464_utt_DAIC_158 and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace
464_utt_DAIC_159 so

464_utt_DAIC_167 and my brothers and sisters

464_utt_DAIC_171 thats_good (that's good)
464_utt_DAIC_172 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
464_utt_DAIC_173 a situation i wish i could handle differently would be
464_utt_DAIC_174 hmm
464_utt_DAIC_175 that's a good question
464_utt_DAIC_176 i mean
464_utt_DAIC_177 can i get a scenerio
464_utt_DAIC_178 mind (whatever comes to your mind)
464_utt_DAIC_179 okay
464_utt_DAIC_180 um
464_utt_DAIC_181 a situation i could handle differently
464_utt_DAIC_182 well see that's the thing like i feel like
464_utt_DAIC_183 if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out
464_utt_DAIC_184 you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube
464_utt_DAIC_185 maybe
464_utt_DAIC_186 how would i handle the situation would be just by
464_utt_DAIC_187 uh failing um failing making mistakes
464_utt_DAIC_188 because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after
464_utt_DAIC_189 so
464_utt_DAIC_190 that's the best way i could answer your question
464_utt_DAIC_191 you know
464_utt_DAIC_192 okay_confirm (okay)
464_utt_DAIC_193 yeah
464_utt_DAIC_194 influence_positive (who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life)

464_utt_DAIC_198 like
464_utt_DAIC_199 yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt
464_utt_DAIC_200 well they're not trying to be mean they're actually
464_utt_DAIC_201 good influences so i would say my friends
464_utt_DAIC_202 uh my mom my dad
464_utt_DAIC_203 my brother my sisters
464_utt_DAIC_204 yeah
464_utt_DAIC_205 mm (mm)

464_utt_DAIC_207 mm
464_utt_DAIC_208 well see that's the thing like
464_utt_DAIC_209 you like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife
464_utt_DAIC_210 but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware
464_utt_DAIC_211 and
464_utt_DAIC_212 it taught me how to read people a little bit more like
464_utt_DAIC_213 just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like
464_utt_DAIC_214 scar me
464_utt_DAIC_215 it did prepare me for like
464_utt_DAIC_216 the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like
464_utt_DAIC_217 you know like guns knives and all that stuff so
464_utt_DAIC_218 Ellie17Dec2012_06 (wow)
464_utt_DAIC_219 it's it's bad but it's good in the long term
464_utt_DAIC_220 you know because
464_utt_DAIC_221 if you get out of that slump
464_utt_DAIC_222 it's like
464_utt_DAIC_223 nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know
464_utt_DAIC_224 and

464_utt_DAIC_239 mm i kinda chose
464_utt_DAIC_240 to like
464_utt_DAIC_241 i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like
464_utt_DAIC_242 like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in
464_utt_DAIC_243 so that was a hard choice because there was no
464_utt_DAIC_244 um guarantee that i would
464_utt_DAIC_245 like
464_utt_DAIC_246 run into like the right people
464_utt_DAIC_247 but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so

464_utt_DAIC_324 pretty much it feels
464_utt_DAIC_325 like you're limited
464_utt_DAIC_326 but then the thing is
464_utt_DAIC_327 to get out of that depression
464_utt_DAIC_328 it's like you have to
464_utt_DAIC_329 awaken and change your perspective
464_utt_DAIC_330 and focus on
464_utt_DAIC_331 like i i would say colors colors help

464_utt_DAIC_360 or just like in my character
464_utt_DAIC_361 and

464_utt_DAIC_364 like
464_utt_DAIC_365 he would listen

468_utt_DAIC_72 just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and mutual funds and

468_utt_DAIC_151 really thinking long term
468_utt_DAIC_152 and uh just seeing them <th> them and
468_utt_DAIC_153 what their family does and
468_utt_DAIC_154 how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to
468_utt_DAIC_155 and they've been very successful they own their own uh

471_utt_DAIC_25 uh the uh the level of
471_utt_DAIC_26 of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that uh eh they're like two different worlds

471_utt_DAIC_29 traveling you mean

471_utt_DAIC_31 uh
471_utt_DAIC_32 i would have to say going to an island off the coast of figi the name is tavarua
471_utt_DAIC_33 and it's a very small island you can walk around it in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes

471_utt_DAIC_49 yes
471_utt_DAIC_50 tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
471_utt_DAIC_51 my father's initial objective when he became an m_d was to become a missionary and uh he's a very
471_utt_DAIC_52 generous person and i think i am too i i i got that from him uh hereditarily
471_utt_DAIC_53 but uh i would like to help people eh and i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's uh disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket
471_utt_DAIC_54 i would like to be uh building people homes and uh helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that
471_utt_DAIC_55 yeah3 (yeah)
471_utt_DAIC_56 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)

471_utt_DAIC_62 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
471_utt_DAIC_63 it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend
471_utt_DAIC_64 and it was about her uh lack of consideration
471_utt_DAIC_65 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
471_utt_DAIC_66 um
471_utt_DAIC_67 i felt frustrated
471_utt_DAIC_68 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
471_utt_DAIC_69 hmm
471_utt_DAIC_70 a situation which
471_utt_DAIC_71 i wished i could handle differently um
471_utt_DAIC_72 i eh in my later years i would say eh i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh
471_utt_DAIC_73 be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior
471_utt_DAIC_74 i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that
471_utt_DAIC_75 is so wrong
471_utt_DAIC_76 and so
471_utt_DAIC_77 in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my
471_utt_DAIC_78 displeasure with someone's actions right away and that
471_utt_DAIC_79 uh takes care of the anger immediately
471_utt_DAIC_80 landed_trouble (has that gotten you in trouble)
471_utt_DAIC_81 yes it <i> it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think
471_utt_DAIC_82 eh all the way around once you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end
471_utt_DAIC_83 uh it diffuses trouble rather than
471_utt_DAIC_84 prolongs or protracts the trouble
471_utt_DAIC_85 makes_sense (that makes sense)
471_utt_DAIC_86 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
471_utt_DAIC_87 uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued
471_utt_DAIC_88 uh at length for many
471_utt_DAIC_89 months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didn't go to
471_utt_DAIC_90 i didn't go that route uh but that was probably the most uh
471_utt_DAIC_91 uh difficult period

471_utt_DAIC_96 uh betrayals uh but now i realize that
471_utt_DAIC_97 keeping those memories make me who i am today and
471_utt_DAIC_98 and dealing with them defines who i am today
471_utt_DAIC_99 mm (mm)
471_utt_DAIC_100 family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
471_utt_DAIC_101 uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very thankful for that

471_utt_DAIC_103 hard-handed uh
471_utt_DAIC_104 and draconian <laughter> person uh we came to an understanding well before he died
471_utt_DAIC_105 and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother
471_utt_DAIC_106 but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they <th> they continue to plague him and to affect
471_utt_DAIC_107 me also just
471_utt_DAIC_108 just knowing that he's going through uh turmoil
471_utt_DAIC_109 im_sorry (i'm sorry)
471_utt_DAIC_110 symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
471_utt_DAIC_111 uh well i guess i really don't cope with it because um
471_utt_DAIC_112 he's clinically depressed
471_utt_DAIC_113 and he has suicidal tendencies
471_utt_DAIC_114 and uh he's not working he's very highly educated
471_utt_DAIC_115 and he uh well he doesn't talk to me

471_utt_DAIC_122 and kind
471_utt_DAIC_123 uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers
471_utt_DAIC_124 understand (i understand)
471_utt_DAIC_125 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
471_utt_DAIC_126 eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having uh just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two
471_utt_DAIC_127 and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago
471_utt_DAIC_128 feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
471_utt_DAIC_129 um
471_utt_DAIC_130 xxx i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress
471_utt_DAIC_131 i i'm okay i'm probably ninety percent okay
471_utt_DAIC_132 that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future
471_utt_DAIC_133 about whether
471_utt_DAIC_134 i will survive this or not
471_utt_DAIC_135 behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately)

471_utt_DAIC_146 good_hear (that's so good to hear)
471_utt_DAIC_147 BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
471_utt_DAIC_148 funny

471_utt_DAIC_151 self_change (what are some things you wish you could change about yourself)
471_utt_DAIC_152 hmm eh that's no one's asked me much about that um
471_utt_DAIC_153 maybe
471_utt_DAIC_154 uh is to submerge my uh
471_utt_DAIC_155 hedonistic self
471_utt_DAIC_156 tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
471_utt_DAIC_157 i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um
471_utt_DAIC_158 uh deferrer of gratification
471_utt_DAIC_159 he
471_utt_DAIC_160 put
471_utt_DAIC_161 now behind him and he put what will be in the future
471_utt_DAIC_162 in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the uh self-made man that he was
471_utt_DAIC_163 whereas i am looking always for the present
471_utt_DAIC_164 um how i feel now and it's difficult for me to
471_utt_DAIC_165 uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away
471_utt_DAIC_166 yeah_downer (yeah)
471_utt_DAIC_167 feelbadly (tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself)
471_utt_DAIC_168 <deep breath> it would be
471_utt_DAIC_169 my ex-boss
471_utt_DAIC_170 and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using
471_utt_DAIC_171 uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way
471_utt_DAIC_172 and he continued to use more profanity
471_utt_DAIC_173 until uh
471_utt_DAIC_174 i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and uh that that's still in my mind and that occurred
471_utt_DAIC_175 a year and a half ago

471_utt_DAIC_180 avoid (could you have done anything to avoid it)
471_utt_DAIC_181 sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that
471_utt_DAIC_182 that would've robbed me of the many opportunities i had
471_utt_DAIC_183 and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because
471_utt_DAIC_184 that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness
471_utt_DAIC_185 because the united states is not the end of the world it is <i> eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not
471_utt_DAIC_186 we do not have the highest
471_utt_DAIC_187 uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree
471_utt_DAIC_188 right2 (right)
471_utt_DAIC_189 see_mean (i see what you mean)
471_utt_DAIC_190 advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
471_utt_DAIC_191 mm
471_utt_DAIC_192 that's a good one i would say
471_utt_DAIC_193 <laughter> i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that
471_utt_DAIC_194 and uh i may be coming to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so
471_utt_DAIC_195 i think i've done i'm i'm happy with my life thus far
471_utt_DAIC_196 Ellie17Dec2012_10 (tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed)
471_utt_DAIC_197 i
471_utt_DAIC_198 was giving a
471_utt_DAIC_199 rock climbing lesson i have a uh part time job of instructing rock climbing
471_utt_DAIC_200 and many of these people have never done it before
471_utt_DAIC_201 and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so

471_utt_DAIC_210 i have been uh vocal in the cause of uh uh being a um
471_utt_DAIC_211 uh a steward

487_utt_DAIC_9 really (really)
487_utt_DAIC_10 yes
487_utt_DAIC_11 when_LA (when did you move to l_a)
487_utt_DAIC_12 i moved to l_a myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here

487_utt_DAIC_18 i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here
487_utt_DAIC_19 in california and
487_utt_DAIC_20 makes_sense (that makes sense)
487_utt_DAIC_21 compares_LA (how does it compare to l_a)
487_utt_DAIC_22 uh completely different um
487_utt_DAIC_23 for me detroit was just very cold it it wasn't
487_utt_DAIC_24 the best for my personality i prefer l_a more open space
487_utt_DAIC_25 a warmer climate warmer people
487_utt_DAIC_26 just a different
487_utt_DAIC_27 different uh vibe
487_utt_DAIC_28 mhm (mhm)
487_utt_DAIC_29 that i that i like better
487_utt_DAIC_30 why_LA (why did you move to l_a)
487_utt_DAIC_31 after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier
487_utt_DAIC_32 to start over here than some of the other places i had lived
487_utt_DAIC_33 or to stay where we were at
487_utt_DAIC_34 adapted_LA (how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a)
487_utt_DAIC_35 extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it
487_utt_DAIC_36 plus i had also
487_utt_DAIC_37 taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here
487_utt_DAIC_38 and went to school out here so i was completely used to it
487_utt_DAIC_39 thats_good (that's good)
487_utt_DAIC_40 yeah3 (yeah)
487_utt_DAIC_41 like_about_LA (what are some things you really like about l_a)
487_utt_DAIC_42 well like i said the weather is number one it's just uh
487_utt_DAIC_43 less crowded it's more open space it's a
487_utt_DAIC_44 a calmer friendlier vibe
487_utt_DAIC_45 less rushed
487_utt_DAIC_46 the smog would be one
487_utt_DAIC_47 and when i drive the traffic
487_utt_DAIC_48 in certain areas it can be but
487_utt_DAIC_49 um
487_utt_DAIC_50 in general
487_utt_DAIC_51 there's not a lot that i don't like <l> it's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's
487_utt_DAIC_52 isn't really that much of a factor 'cause it rarely happens
487_utt_DAIC_53 see_mean (i see what you mean)
487_utt_DAIC_54 the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one that i don't necessarily like
487_utt_DAIC_55 yeah3 (yeah)
487_utt_DAIC_56 travel_shoes (i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot)
487_utt_DAIC_57 i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all
487_utt_DAIC_58 so
487_utt_DAIC_59 i don't travel as much as i used to
487_utt_DAIC_60 but i have traveled worldwide
487_utt_DAIC_61 travel_changed (what do you enjoy about traveling)
487_utt_DAIC_62 new experiences
487_utt_DAIC_63 travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips)
487_utt_DAIC_64 well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled
487_utt_DAIC_65 through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so
487_utt_DAIC_66 i've traveled a lot of different places and
487_utt_DAIC_67 um i'll have to say they were
487_utt_DAIC_68 all pretty much enjoyable 'cause you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn
487_utt_DAIC_69 enjoy experience
487_utt_DAIC_70 uh_huh (uh huh)
487_utt_DAIC_71 memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences)
487_utt_DAIC_72 uh my experiences i would say in um
487_utt_DAIC_73 europe visiting moreso i've also visited
487_utt_DAIC_74 uh in south south america i guess 'cause the cultures are so very different
487_utt_DAIC_75 yeah3 (yeah)
487_utt_DAIC_76 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
487_utt_DAIC_77 i would probably say more shy um in general
487_utt_DAIC_78 um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing
487_utt_DAIC_79 although
487_utt_DAIC_80 i've had them describe me as outgoing
487_utt_DAIC_81 okay_confirm (okay)
487_utt_DAIC_82 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
487_utt_DAIC_83 i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike
487_utt_DAIC_84 mhm (mhm)
487_utt_DAIC_85 listen to music you know
487_utt_DAIC_86 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
487_utt_DAIC_87 i'm very good at controlling my temper
487_utt_DAIC_88 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
487_utt_DAIC_89 oh
487_utt_DAIC_90 probably when i was
487_utt_DAIC_91 married with my husband many years ago
487_utt_DAIC_92 it it could be many things i don't even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him
487_utt_DAIC_93 okay_confirm (okay)
487_utt_DAIC_94 it could be it could be a choice of
487_utt_DAIC_95 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
487_utt_DAIC_96 uh
487_utt_DAIC_97 some of the instances when i might've been with him and i
487_utt_DAIC_98 you know got emotional or
487_utt_DAIC_99 let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than
487_utt_DAIC_100 um
487_utt_DAIC_101 just you know seen it as
487_utt_DAIC_102 not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so
487_utt_DAIC_103 you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate
487_utt_DAIC_104 but some people
487_utt_DAIC_105 you know don't respond to the so-called norm
487_utt_DAIC_106 if you ignore it
487_utt_DAIC_107 mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case
487_utt_DAIC_108 i taught middle school kids and you can try calm
487_utt_DAIC_109 yeah_downer (yeah)
487_utt_DAIC_110 um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain
487_utt_DAIC_111 you know your professional demeanor so you can't really
487_utt_DAIC_112 um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so
487_utt_DAIC_113 see_mean (i see what you mean)
487_utt_DAIC_114 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
487_utt_DAIC_115 well that could be
487_utt_DAIC_116 several
487_utt_DAIC_117 mm
487_utt_DAIC_118 um i guess a decision in um
487_utt_DAIC_119 along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery
487_utt_DAIC_120 uh
487_utt_DAIC_121 that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way
487_utt_DAIC_122 and in that case she died so
487_utt_DAIC_123 you know
487_utt_DAIC_124 uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious
487_utt_DAIC_125 outcome for them as well
487_utt_DAIC_126 yeah_downer (yeah)
487_utt_DAIC_127 sorry_hear (i'm sorry to hear that)
487_utt_DAIC_128 mhm
487_utt_DAIC_129 memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
487_utt_DAIC_130 <sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing
487_utt_DAIC_131 things that you might could do but
487_utt_DAIC_132 they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to
487_utt_DAIC_133 erase them you know if
487_utt_DAIC_134 you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a
487_utt_DAIC_135 strong reaction and they don't really look past the
487_utt_DAIC_136 uh impact of the event
487_utt_DAIC_137 'cause there might be something that
487_utt_DAIC_138 mm (mm)
487_utt_DAIC_139 you can gain from that
487_utt_DAIC_140 yeah3 (yeah)
487_utt_DAIC_141 but there are i i grew up in a home of
487_utt_DAIC_142 dysfunction so there was
487_utt_DAIC_143 just domestic abuse you know and um
487_utt_DAIC_144 there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things
487_utt_DAIC_145 but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things
487_utt_DAIC_146 that occur in life as an adult that
487_utt_DAIC_147 sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that
487_utt_DAIC_148 have not had really strong experiences
487_utt_DAIC_149 fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so
487_utt_DAIC_150 right2 (right)
487_utt_DAIC_151 symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
487_utt_DAIC_152 um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can
487_utt_DAIC_153 walk them through
487_utt_DAIC_154 levels of
487_utt_DAIC_155 understanding and you know
487_utt_DAIC_156 as you know someone
487_utt_DAIC_157 you have a balance of background information on
487_utt_DAIC_158 which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will
487_utt_DAIC_159 progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like
487_utt_DAIC_160 the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be
487_utt_DAIC_161 and you can also relate other experiences to them
487_utt_DAIC_162 of things that were worse or
487_utt_DAIC_163 you know seem to be
487_utt_DAIC_164 and of course there's always in general i mean
487_utt_DAIC_165 when you look at all the calamities in the world
487_utt_DAIC_166 you know most of those things aren't affecting
487_utt_DAIC_167 us or the people that we know here
487_utt_DAIC_168 mhm (mhm)
487_utt_DAIC_169 so that provides
487_utt_DAIC_170 us perspective that
487_utt_DAIC_171 you know can pull someone out of their
487_utt_DAIC_172 i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly
487_utt_DAIC_173 intensity of their experience right at the moment
487_utt_DAIC_174 yeah_downer (yeah)
487_utt_DAIC_175 family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
487_utt_DAIC_176 well we have a a good relationship they
487_utt_DAIC_177 eh for the most part there are different levels of
487_utt_DAIC_178 um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has
487_utt_DAIC_179 made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others
487_utt_DAIC_180 some have not had um
487_utt_DAIC_181 as much
487_utt_DAIC_182 experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way
487_utt_DAIC_183 so it's always evolving
487_utt_DAIC_184 and i
487_utt_DAIC_185 walk in positivity as a a lead of
487_utt_DAIC_186 you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender
487_utt_DAIC_187 a more positive
487_utt_DAIC_188 response from them
487_utt_DAIC_189 rather than feed
487_utt_DAIC_190 sometimes the
487_utt_DAIC_191 um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have
487_utt_DAIC_192 mm (mm)
487_utt_DAIC_193 influence_positive (who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life)
487_utt_DAIC_194 pardon
487_utt_DAIC_195 i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat
487_utt_DAIC_196 influence_positive (who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life)
487_utt_DAIC_197 hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends
487_utt_DAIC_198 tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
487_utt_DAIC_199 well my mother has always been a very calm
487_utt_DAIC_200 um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of
487_utt_DAIC_201 negativity i've had teachers that have um been
487_utt_DAIC_202 very um
487_utt_DAIC_203 positive <po> positive and proactive
487_utt_DAIC_204 and have you know taught independent thinking and
487_utt_DAIC_205 techniques to rise above some of the things that
487_utt_DAIC_206 were occurring
487_utt_DAIC_207 and just various friends that you know i would see handling
487_utt_DAIC_208 situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so
487_utt_DAIC_209 okay_confirm (okay)
487_utt_DAIC_210 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
487_utt_DAIC_211 it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good
487_utt_DAIC_212 um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or
487_utt_DAIC_213 you know um
487_utt_DAIC_214 trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but
487_utt_DAIC_215 um

488_utt_DAIC_37 all the different
488_utt_DAIC_38 ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy
488_utt_DAIC_39 makes_sense (that makes sense)

488_utt_DAIC_49 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)

488_utt_DAIC_57 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
488_utt_DAIC_58 i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend
488_utt_DAIC_59 um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um
488_utt_DAIC_60 i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party
488_utt_DAIC_61 and he was getting frustrated
488_utt_DAIC_62 which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with
488_utt_DAIC_63 yeah_downer (yeah)
488_utt_DAIC_64 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
488_utt_DAIC_65 well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and
488_utt_DAIC_66 i
488_utt_DAIC_67 really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out

488_utt_DAIC_69 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
488_utt_DAIC_70 hmm
488_utt_DAIC_71 i think a lot of times when my

488_utt_DAIC_74 as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i
488_utt_DAIC_75 and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him

488_utt_DAIC_81 i came home
488_utt_DAIC_82 from a party
488_utt_DAIC_83 i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things

488_utt_DAIC_88 um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could
488_utt_DAIC_89 um <sigh>
488_utt_DAIC_90 and i love my siblings i
488_utt_DAIC_91 again my little sister and i get along really well she's
488_utt_DAIC_92 four years younger than me
488_utt_DAIC_93 and when
488_utt_DAIC_94 when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and
488_utt_DAIC_95 i wasn't
488_utt_DAIC_96 in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore
488_utt_DAIC_97 and that's really great
488_utt_DAIC_98 and
488_utt_DAIC_99 we get along okay with my uh

488_utt_DAIC_105 uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and
488_utt_DAIC_106 who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that

488_utt_DAIC_108 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
488_utt_DAIC_109 i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but

488_utt_DAIC_140 BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
488_utt_DAIC_141 um she would probably say that
488_utt_DAIC_142 i'm smart and uh
488_utt_DAIC_143 pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch
488_utt_DAIC_144 really like serious films and t_v

488_utt_DAIC_151 hmm
488_utt_DAIC_152 um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh

488_utt_DAIC_155 sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was
488_utt_DAIC_156 very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem
488_utt_DAIC_157 like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock
488_utt_DAIC_158 speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job
488_utt_DAIC_159 but it was
488_utt_DAIC_160 was not

488_utt_DAIC_166 um
488_utt_DAIC_167 but i think
488_utt_DAIC_168 i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think
488_utt_DAIC_169 i was a little selfish and self-involved back then
488_utt_DAIC_170 regret (is there anything you regret)
