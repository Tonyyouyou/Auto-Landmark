307_utt_DAIC_0 hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend i don't judge i can't i'm a computer   
307_utt_DAIC_1 i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential 
307_utt_DAIC_2 <laughter>
307_utt_DAIC_3 where are you from originally
307_utt_DAIC_4 um moscow
307_utt_DAIC_5 really
307_utt_DAIC_6 why'd you move to l_a
307_utt_DAIC_7 um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college
307_utt_DAIC_8 how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
307_utt_DAIC_9  uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though
307_utt_DAIC_10 that's good
307_utt_DAIC_11 how do you like your living situation
307_utt_DAIC_12 it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between
307_utt_DAIC_13 [laughter]
307_utt_DAIC_14 the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while
307_utt_DAIC_15 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_16 how do you know them
307_utt_DAIC_17 one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist
307_utt_DAIC_18 how close are you to them
307_utt_DAIC_19 it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um
307_utt_DAIC_20 i guess pretty close
307_utt_DAIC_21 right now we're kinda distant
307_utt_DAIC_22 aww
307_utt_DAIC_23 tell me more about that
307_utt_DAIC_24 oh about the distant
307_utt_DAIC_25 yes
307_utt_DAIC_26 okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks
307_utt_DAIC_27 'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room
307_utt_DAIC_28 uh oh
307_utt_DAIC_29 and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of
307_utt_DAIC_30 we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move 
307_utt_DAIC_31 yeah that sucks
307_utt_DAIC_32 it's okay it'll get better
307_utt_DAIC_33 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_34 how are you at controlling your temper
307_utt_DAIC_35 it depends with whom 
307_utt_DAIC_36 i'm
307_utt_DAIC_37 dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good
307_utt_DAIC_38 but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger
307_utt_DAIC_39 why
307_utt_DAIC_40 oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter]
307_utt_DAIC_41 [laughter]
307_utt_DAIC_42 that makes sense
307_utt_DAIC_43 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_44 who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
307_utt_DAIC_45 uh probably my best friend nicole
307_utt_DAIC_46 she's probably been we've been best friends for like
307_utt_DAIC_47 god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah
307_utt_DAIC_48 wow
307_utt_DAIC_49 um
307_utt_DAIC_50 can you give me an example of that
307_utt_DAIC_51 of
307_utt_DAIC_52 of what 
307_utt_DAIC_53 how do you know them
307_utt_DAIC_54 uh my friend nicole
307_utt_DAIC_55 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_56 um we met in french class freshman year of high school
307_utt_DAIC_57 we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then
307_utt_DAIC_58 nice
307_utt_DAIC_59 mhm
307_utt_DAIC_60 what are some things you like to do for fun
307_utt_DAIC_61 um
307_utt_DAIC_62 uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking
307_utt_DAIC_63 staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography
307_utt_DAIC_64 um
307_utt_DAIC_65 just hanging out with friends i guess
307_utt_DAIC_66 whatever
307_utt_DAIC_67 okay
307_utt_DAIC_68 how close are you to your family
307_utt_DAIC_69 uh
307_utt_DAIC_70 it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um
307_utt_DAIC_71 those kinds of
307_utt_DAIC_72 things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things
307_utt_DAIC_73  i don't really discuss that with them
307_utt_DAIC_74 mm
307_utt_DAIC_75 so i guess superficially close
307_utt_DAIC_76 okay
307_utt_DAIC_77 but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess
307_utt_DAIC_78 that's good
307_utt_DAIC_79 mhm
307_utt_DAIC_80 what are some things that make you really mad
307_utt_DAIC_81 uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again
307_utt_DAIC_82 i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant
307_utt_DAIC_83 and
307_utt_DAIC_84 uh
307_utt_DAIC_85 conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um
307_utt_DAIC_86 what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter]
307_utt_DAIC_87 but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess
307_utt_DAIC_88 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_89  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
307_utt_DAIC_90 uh yesterday
307_utt_DAIC_91 and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money 
307_utt_DAIC_92 and so and
307_utt_DAIC_93 so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy
307_utt_DAIC_94 and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through
307_utt_DAIC_95 [laughter]
307_utt_DAIC_96 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_97 do you feel that way often
307_utt_DAIC_98 about other people or about myself or angry
307_utt_DAIC_99 whatever comes to your mind
307_utt_DAIC_100 xxxx [laughter]
307_utt_DAIC_101 um
307_utt_DAIC_102 angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often
307_utt_DAIC_103 okay
307_utt_DAIC_104 what's your dream job
307_utt_DAIC_105 dang it
307_utt_DAIC_106 that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me
307_utt_DAIC_107 um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring
307_utt_DAIC_108 so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um
307_utt_DAIC_109  my dream job
307_utt_DAIC_110 i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end
307_utt_DAIC_111 i guess it's something that i realized
307_utt_DAIC_112 i like to see
307_utt_DAIC_113 the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so
307_utt_DAIC_114 mhm
307_utt_DAIC_115 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_116 something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography
307_utt_DAIC_117 i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something
307_utt_DAIC_118 in that
307_utt_DAIC_119 realm i guess
307_utt_DAIC_120 okay
307_utt_DAIC_121 do you travel a lot
307_utt_DAIC_122 i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to
307_utt_DAIC_123 gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries
307_utt_DAIC_124 wow
307_utt_DAIC_125 i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that
307_utt_DAIC_126 i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome
307_utt_DAIC_127 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_128 um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot
307_utt_DAIC_129 what do you enjoy about traveling
307_utt_DAIC_130 in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and
307_utt_DAIC_131 see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to
307_utt_DAIC_132 stir things up
307_utt_DAIC_133 i see what you mean
307_utt_DAIC_134 i'd love to hear about one of your trips
307_utt_DAIC_135 oh gosh okay um
307_utt_DAIC_136 i'm trying to think
307_utt_DAIC_137 one of my trips
307_utt_DAIC_138 i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is
307_utt_DAIC_139 one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon
307_utt_DAIC_140 oh my gosh
307_utt_DAIC_141 i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places
307_utt_DAIC_142 i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so
307_utt_DAIC_143 um
307_utt_DAIC_144 and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made
307_utt_DAIC_145 and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like
307_utt_DAIC_146 white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful
307_utt_DAIC_147 or something that's different too
307_utt_DAIC_148 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_149 i see what you mean
307_utt_DAIC_150 cool
307_utt_DAIC_151 how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
307_utt_DAIC_152 um
307_utt_DAIC_153 pretty easy as long as I
307_utt_DAIC_154 get well no i always sleep so easy
307_utt_DAIC_155 what are you like when you don't sleep well
307_utt_DAIC_156 oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world
307_utt_DAIC_157 do you feel that way often
307_utt_DAIC_158 i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of 
307_utt_DAIC_159 energizing me so no it's not too bad
307_utt_DAIC_160 that's good
307_utt_DAIC_161 have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
307_utt_DAIC_162 uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in
307_utt_DAIC_163 so
307_utt_DAIC_164 it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing
307_utt_DAIC_165 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_166 it can be tough to find a good job these days
307_utt_DAIC_167 yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for
307_utt_DAIC_168 mhm
307_utt_DAIC_169 so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck
307_utt_DAIC_170 barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like
307_utt_DAIC_171 when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know
307_utt_DAIC_172 that sounds really hard
307_utt_DAIC_173 yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so
307_utt_DAIC_174 but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh
307_utt_DAIC_175 all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so
307_utt_DAIC_176 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_177 do you feel down
307_utt_DAIC_178 uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]
307_utt_DAIC_179 nice
307_utt_DAIC_180 yes
307_utt_DAIC_181 but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because
307_utt_DAIC_182 i'm just trying to find like what
307_utt_DAIC_183 i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries
307_utt_DAIC_184 so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation
307_utt_DAIC_185 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_186 i'm sorry
307_utt_DAIC_187 it's all good
307_utt_DAIC_188 have you been diagnosed with depression
307_utt_DAIC_189 uh no i don't think so but i mean
307_utt_DAIC_190 i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can
307_utt_DAIC_191 but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds
307_utt_DAIC_192 okay
307_utt_DAIC_193 have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
307_utt_DAIC_194 nope
307_utt_DAIC_195 have you ever served in the military
307_utt_DAIC_196 nope
307_utt_DAIC_197 okay
307_utt_DAIC_198 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
307_utt_DAIC_199 oh let's see
307_utt_DAIC_200 uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail
307_utt_DAIC_201 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home
307_utt_DAIC_202 so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it
307_utt_DAIC_203 so
307_utt_DAIC_204 ten years ago
307_utt_DAIC_205 like what
307_utt_DAIC_206 well that would've made me like twelve so
307_utt_DAIC_207  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act
307_utt_DAIC_208 i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time
307_utt_DAIC_209 and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it
307_utt_DAIC_210 and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes 
307_utt_DAIC_211 um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just
307_utt_DAIC_212 expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder
307_utt_DAIC_213 kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good
307_utt_DAIC_214 i don't try to go above that
307_utt_DAIC_215 if that makes any sense
307_utt_DAIC_216 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_217 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_218 what do you do to relax
307_utt_DAIC_219 uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v
307_utt_DAIC_220 [laughter]
307_utt_DAIC_221 but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap
307_utt_DAIC_222 or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done
307_utt_DAIC_223 so
307_utt_DAIC_224 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_225 what's one of your most memorable experiences 
307_utt_DAIC_226 [laughter]
307_utt_DAIC_227 that's a tough question
307_utt_DAIC_228 um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college
307_utt_DAIC_229 um
307_utt_DAIC_230 i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east
307_utt_DAIC_231 and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year
307_utt_DAIC_232 aww
307_utt_DAIC_233 and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont
307_utt_DAIC_234 and um
307_utt_DAIC_235 i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in
307_utt_DAIC_236 and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing 
307_utt_DAIC_237 mhm
307_utt_DAIC_238 um
307_utt_DAIC_239 but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like
307_utt_DAIC_240 um
307_utt_DAIC_241 just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well
307_utt_DAIC_242 and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not
307_utt_DAIC_243 um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy
307_utt_DAIC_244 that's probably one
307_utt_DAIC_245 that's great
307_utt_DAIC_246 yeah
307_utt_DAIC_247 it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]

331_utt_DAIC_103 and um 
331_utt_DAIC_104 that's about it 
331_utt_DAIC_105 okay 
331_utt_DAIC_106 have you ever served in the military 
331_utt_DAIC_107 no
331_utt_DAIC_108 have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
331_utt_DAIC_109 yes 
331_utt_DAIC_110 how long ago were you diagnosed 
331_utt_DAIC_111 uh about four years ago 
331_utt_DAIC_112 what got you to seek help 
331_utt_DAIC_113 um i well i had <ha> i was beaten up and i had uh identity theft
331_utt_DAIC_114 and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving
331_utt_DAIC_115 um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did   
331_utt_DAIC_116 yeah i'm sorry to hear that 
331_utt_DAIC_117 thank you 
331_utt_DAIC_118 how have you been feeling lately 
331_utt_DAIC_119 um okay i'm panicky about the job situation 
331_utt_DAIC_120 um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now 
331_utt_DAIC_121 uh huh
331_utt_DAIC_122 so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation 
331_utt_DAIC_123 that sounds really hard 
331_utt_DAIC_124 yeah 
331_utt_DAIC_125 have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately 
331_utt_DAIC_126 um 
331_utt_DAIC_127 yeah i mean 
331_utt_DAIC_128 well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing 
331_utt_DAIC_129 that's great 
331_utt_DAIC_130 yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink  
331_utt_DAIC_131 mhm
331_utt_DAIC_132 um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself
331_utt_DAIC_133 now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving 
331_utt_DAIC_134 that's good 
331_utt_DAIC_135 have you been diagnosed with depression 
331_utt_DAIC_136 uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um
331_utt_DAIC_137 they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would 
331_utt_DAIC_138 make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin 
331_utt_DAIC_139 just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state  
331_utt_DAIC_140 how hard is that
331_utt_DAIC_141 yeah
331_utt_DAIC_142 did you think you had a problem before you found out 
331_utt_DAIC_143 um not really 
331_utt_DAIC_144 what were your symptoms 
331_utt_DAIC_145 always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i
331_utt_DAIC_146 eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed
331_utt_DAIC_147 yeah 
331_utt_DAIC_148 do you feel like therapy's useful 
331_utt_DAIC_149 i do
331_utt_DAIC_150 at some point i've had
331_utt_DAIC_151 some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists 
331_utt_DAIC_152 um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me
331_utt_DAIC_153 and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen  
331_utt_DAIC_154 mhm
331_utt_DAIC_155 and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist
331_utt_DAIC_156 yeah i see what you mean 
331_utt_DAIC_157 what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
331_utt_DAIC_158 um
331_utt_DAIC_159 well i'm not going to therapy now but 
331_utt_DAIC_160 the therapy that i had before um 
331_utt_DAIC_161 was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication
331_utt_DAIC_162 um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better 
331_utt_DAIC_163 mm
331_utt_DAIC_164 why did you stop 
331_utt_DAIC_165 um i just
331_utt_DAIC_166 i wasn't getting the right therapists recently
331_utt_DAIC_167 so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so 
331_utt_DAIC_168 mhm
331_utt_DAIC_169 mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know 
331_utt_DAIC_170 yeah 
331_utt_DAIC_171 okay 
331_utt_DAIC_172 tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed 
331_utt_DAIC_173 um

331_utt_DAIC_177 um 
331_utt_DAIC_178 it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy 
331_utt_DAIC_179 i'm sorry to hear that 
331_utt_DAIC_180 thank you <sniffle>
331_utt_DAIC_181 what's one of your most memorable experiences 
331_utt_DAIC_182 um

331_utt_DAIC_184 um 
331_utt_DAIC_185 i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it

331_utt_DAIC_187 came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them 
331_utt_DAIC_188 so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that  
331_utt_DAIC_189 <laughter>
331_utt_DAIC_190 <laughter> 
331_utt_DAIC_191 oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences

331_utt_DAIC_196 is there anything you regret 
331_utt_DAIC_197 um
331_utt_DAIC_198 just the way that i've treated people before when
331_utt_DAIC_199 i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people
331_utt_DAIC_200 when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so 
331_utt_DAIC_201 mhm
331_utt_DAIC_202 so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable 
331_utt_DAIC_203 that's good
331_utt_DAIC_204 yeah 
331_utt_DAIC_205 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
331_utt_DAIC_206 get in a career that is really stable 
331_utt_DAIC_207 like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney
331_utt_DAIC_208 something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so
331_utt_DAIC_209 you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things 
331_utt_DAIC_210 yeah
331_utt_DAIC_211 that makes sense 
331_utt_DAIC_212 what are some things that usually put you in a good mood 
331_utt_DAIC_213 um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work 
331_utt_DAIC_214 uh when i'm helping other people

335_utt_DAIC_48 artsy people and i grew up around it and for a long time i was singing and then uh i was went to study musical theater

335_utt_DAIC_114 why

335_utt_DAIC_209 uh my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well  
335_utt_DAIC_210 uh my best friend my best friend from high school i think i uh some <so> a few of my best friends from high school um and college that i've kinda grown up with and

335_utt_DAIC_219 yeah
335_utt_DAIC_220 uh
335_utt_DAIC_221 i regret 
335_utt_DAIC_222 the way that i dealt with
335_utt_DAIC_223 a friendship that was ending once uh i regret 
335_utt_DAIC_224 committing to certain people that i've dated 
335_utt_DAIC_225 uh 
335_utt_DAIC_226 but nothing huge i i tend to go well i won't do that again but i don't spend a lot of time

335_utt_DAIC_237 i don't have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in but sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself
335_utt_DAIC_238 i think i i really internalize the idea of like
335_utt_DAIC_239 you know women being too needy or uh or um
335_utt_DAIC_240 i don't know those kinds of things and then xxx and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me a while to be able to like voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with that
335_utt_DAIC_241 uh huh uh huh 
335_utt_DAIC_242 and it's still something i work on 
335_utt_DAIC_243 that makes sense

346_utt_DAIC_136 i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just 
346_utt_DAIC_137 i'm just not a not a nice person to be around 
346_utt_DAIC_138 how do you cope with them 
346_utt_DAIC_139 um 
346_utt_DAIC_140 i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um 
346_utt_DAIC_141 just to keep myself involved 
346_utt_DAIC_142 um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can 
346_utt_DAIC_143 um by running around and and and doing things 
346_utt_DAIC_144 so 
346_utt_DAIC_145 mhm
346_utt_DAIC_146 how hard is that 
346_utt_DAIC_147 um it's difficult 
346_utt_DAIC_148 um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna 
346_utt_DAIC_149 i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh 
346_utt_DAIC_150 i make appointments to like for auditions or or um 
346_utt_DAIC_151 even to do this i um i i tend to uh 
346_utt_DAIC_152 just not 
346_utt_DAIC_153 like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways  
346_utt_DAIC_154 yeah 
346_utt_DAIC_155 i see
346_utt_DAIC_156 have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
346_utt_DAIC_157 yes 
346_utt_DAIC_158 how long ago were you diagnosed 
346_utt_DAIC_159 um i've been diagnosed for two instances 
346_utt_DAIC_160 um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago 
346_utt_DAIC_161 and then i was diagnosed again um in august
346_utt_DAIC_162 what got you to seek help 
346_utt_DAIC_163 um 
346_utt_DAIC_164 the first time it was um 
346_utt_DAIC_165 i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um  
346_utt_DAIC_166 and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress 
346_utt_DAIC_167 uh huh 
346_utt_DAIC_168 um 
346_utt_DAIC_169 and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um 
346_utt_DAIC_170 and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore 
346_utt_DAIC_171 so i i figured um 
346_utt_DAIC_172 i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um 
346_utt_DAIC_173 not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated 
346_utt_DAIC_174 yeah 
346_utt_DAIC_175 that sounds really hard 
346_utt_DAIC_176 yeah 
346_utt_DAIC_177 it was 
346_utt_DAIC_178 do you still go to therapy now
346_utt_DAIC_179 i no <n> do not
346_utt_DAIC_180 why did you stop 
346_utt_DAIC_181 um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um 
346_utt_DAIC_182 get out of my environment 
346_utt_DAIC_183 um
346_utt_DAIC_184 and uh 
346_utt_DAIC_185 and that seemed to help a lot 
346_utt_DAIC_186 um 
346_utt_DAIC_187 uh huh
346_utt_DAIC_188 and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much 
346_utt_DAIC_189 um they just 
346_utt_DAIC_190 i'm sorry to hear that 
346_utt_DAIC_191 they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed 
346_utt_DAIC_192 um 
346_utt_DAIC_193 yeah 
346_utt_DAIC_194 yeah so um 
346_utt_DAIC_195 yeah 
346_utt_DAIC_196 how have you been feeling lately 
346_utt_DAIC_197 <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why  
346_utt_DAIC_198 um 
346_utt_DAIC_199 but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um  
346_utt_DAIC_200 keeping myself busy 
346_utt_DAIC_201 that's good 
346_utt_DAIC_202 when was the last time you felt really happy 
346_utt_DAIC_203 um 
346_utt_DAIC_204 actually um 
346_utt_DAIC_205 i'm kind of
346_utt_DAIC_206 a couple days ago 
346_utt_DAIC_207 i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy  
346_utt_DAIC_208 um but then i went back to 
346_utt_DAIC_209 being you know going back to feeling miserable 
346_utt_DAIC_210 so
346_utt_DAIC_211 can you tell me about that 
346_utt_DAIC_212 um 
346_utt_DAIC_213 well i realized 
346_utt_DAIC_214 i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep 
346_utt_DAIC_215 and um 
346_utt_DAIC_216 i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky 
346_utt_DAIC_217 um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me 
346_utt_DAIC_218 and uh 
346_utt_DAIC_219 you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that 
346_utt_DAIC_220 and that made me really happy 
346_utt_DAIC_221 um 
346_utt_DAIC_222 that's so good to hear 
346_utt_DAIC_223 yeah 
346_utt_DAIC_224 thank you <laughter>
346_utt_DAIC_225 what are you most proud of in your life 
346_utt_DAIC_226 oh geez
346_utt_DAIC_227 um 
346_utt_DAIC_228 i've had so many years of just 
346_utt_DAIC_229 just bad just a lot of bad 
346_utt_DAIC_230 that it there has it's been a long time 
346_utt_DAIC_231 since i've been proud of anything 
346_utt_DAIC_232 i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through 
346_utt_DAIC_233 mhm
346_utt_DAIC_234 um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've 
346_utt_DAIC_235 gotten rid of themselves a long time ago 
346_utt_DAIC_236 but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um 
346_utt_DAIC_237 there's gotta be a silver lining 
346_utt_DAIC_238 so 
346_utt_DAIC_239 yeah 
346_utt_DAIC_240 um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh 
346_utt_DAIC_241 i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people 
346_utt_DAIC_242 and um 
346_utt_DAIC_243 and truthful and i still i still have drive in me 
346_utt_DAIC_244 that's great
346_utt_DAIC_245 yeah 
346_utt_DAIC_246 is there anything you regret
346_utt_DAIC_247 ugh <sigh> so much um 
346_utt_DAIC_248 my last marriage
346_utt_DAIC_249 um not getting out when i should have 
346_utt_DAIC_250 um 
346_utt_DAIC_251 and uh just
346_utt_DAIC_252 i regret a lot
346_utt_DAIC_253 what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
346_utt_DAIC_254 <sigh>
346_utt_DAIC_255 um the any situation that would've had a red flag um 
346_utt_DAIC_256 eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work
346_utt_DAIC_257 and um 
346_utt_DAIC_258 no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um 
346_utt_DAIC_259 i i would tell myself um to um 
346_utt_DAIC_260 that it's not selfish 
346_utt_DAIC_261 to let go of a bad situation 
346_utt_DAIC_262 and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself 
346_utt_DAIC_263 yeah 
346_utt_DAIC_264 so if
346_utt_DAIC_265 mhm
346_utt_DAIC_266 had i known that then had had i known that
346_utt_DAIC_267 then i i i probably would've done better in life
346_utt_DAIC_268 so 
346_utt_DAIC_269 i see what you mean 
346_utt_DAIC_270 yeah 
346_utt_DAIC_271 what are some things that make you really mad

346_utt_DAIC_276 um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um 
346_utt_DAIC_277 people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy
346_utt_DAIC_278 um
346_utt_DAIC_279 just anybody who picks on the little guy 
346_utt_DAIC_280 um 
346_utt_DAIC_281 you know people who don't care about the environment or animals
346_utt_DAIC_282 um 
346_utt_DAIC_283 mhm
346_utt_DAIC_284 i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be 
346_utt_DAIC_285 and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do 
346_utt_DAIC_286 and uh i that makes me mad 
346_utt_DAIC_287 yeah

346_utt_DAIC_290 <laughter> i vent <laughter> um 
346_utt_DAIC_291 yeah i tend to vent and then uh 
346_utt_DAIC_292 and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um
346_utt_DAIC_293 i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore
346_utt_DAIC_294 that's good 
346_utt_DAIC_295 how are you at controlling your temper
346_utt_DAIC_296 mm

346_utt_DAIC_298 because i have a really bad temper
346_utt_DAIC_299 and it um 
346_utt_DAIC_300 and it can get outta hand so um 
346_utt_DAIC_301 what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap
346_utt_DAIC_302  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind

367_utt_DAIC_3 how_doingV (so how are you doing today)
367_utt_DAIC_4 i'm okay um
367_utt_DAIC_5 i'm a little
367_utt_DAIC_6 pensive i guess a little
367_utt_DAIC_7 uh down but
367_utt_DAIC_8 more or less okay
367_utt_DAIC_9 sorry_hear (i'm sorry to hear that)
367_utt_DAIC_10 where_originally (where are you from originally)
367_utt_DAIC_11 i was born in annapolis maryland
367_utt_DAIC_12 really (really)
367_utt_DAIC_13 on the east coast
367_utt_DAIC_14 why_LA (why did you move to l_a)
367_utt_DAIC_15 originally i moved because i went to film school um
367_utt_DAIC_16 and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again
367_utt_DAIC_17 adapted_LA (how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a)
367_utt_DAIC_18 it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um
367_utt_DAIC_19 but living
367_utt_DAIC_20 l_a is very has a very different kind of
367_utt_DAIC_21 um
367_utt_DAIC_22 attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i
367_utt_DAIC_23 but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here
367_utt_DAIC_24 often_backB (how often do you go back to your hometown)
367_utt_DAIC_25 uh not at all um
367_utt_DAIC_26 when i left things got things were sort of i
367_utt_DAIC_27 i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um
367_utt_DAIC_28 to be with
367_utt_DAIC_29 uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of
367_utt_DAIC_30 i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of
367_utt_DAIC_31 not really speaking to my family or old friends that often
367_utt_DAIC_32 difficult (how hard is that)
367_utt_DAIC_33 it's not easy it's
367_utt_DAIC_34 it's kind of um
367_utt_DAIC_35 i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job
367_utt_DAIC_36 um i miss um some friends um
367_utt_DAIC_37 i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot
367_utt_DAIC_38 um i feel like i failed
367_utt_DAIC_39 and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard
367_utt_DAIC_40 yeah_downer (yeah)
367_utt_DAIC_41 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
367_utt_DAIC_42 depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable
367_utt_DAIC_43 um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy
367_utt_DAIC_44 so that doesn't really answer your question but
367_utt_DAIC_45 okay_confirm (okay)
367_utt_DAIC_46 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
367_utt_DAIC_47 um [clears throat]
367_utt_DAIC_48 i have certain
367_utt_DAIC_49 i do i do a lot of writing
367_utt_DAIC_50 um i have certain
367_utt_DAIC_51 music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can
367_utt_DAIC_52 when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of
367_utt_DAIC_53 happening really um
367_utt_DAIC_54 it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess
367_utt_DAIC_55 mhm (mhm)
367_utt_DAIC_56 bouts_symptoms (when was the last time that happened)
367_utt_DAIC_57 um
367_utt_DAIC_58 a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel
367_utt_DAIC_59 and when i was really
367_utt_DAIC_60 when i was really getting into writing it and um
367_utt_DAIC_61 it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed
367_utt_DAIC_62 cool3 (cool)
367_utt_DAIC_63 argument_about (what was it about)
367_utt_DAIC_64 um
367_utt_DAIC_65 it was about a
367_utt_DAIC_66 guy who is searching for
367_utt_DAIC_67 something it's
367_utt_DAIC_68 it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he
367_utt_DAIC_69 that he
367_utt_DAIC_70 met and just
367_utt_DAIC_71 was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because
367_utt_DAIC_72 sort of uh it's sort of romantic
367_utt_DAIC_73 adventure comedy kind of thing
367_utt_DAIC_74 mm (mm)
367_utt_DAIC_75 change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
367_utt_DAIC_76 well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting
367_utt_DAIC_77 um so i wrote some screenplays and uh
367_utt_DAIC_78 you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer
367_utt_DAIC_79 just creative writing so
367_utt_DAIC_80 i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to
367_utt_DAIC_81 to really hit me
367_utt_DAIC_82 uh_huh (uh huh)
367_utt_DAIC_83 difficult (how hard is that)
367_utt_DAIC_84 it's not easy the [exhale]
367_utt_DAIC_85 the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um
367_utt_DAIC_86 i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i
367_utt_DAIC_87 hate it because it's so difficult
367_utt_DAIC_88 um
367_utt_DAIC_89 but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good
367_utt_DAIC_90 yeah3 (yeah)
367_utt_DAIC_91 see_mean (i see what you mean)
367_utt_DAIC_92 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
367_utt_DAIC_93 good i don't i don't really have a temper i
367_utt_DAIC_94 it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people
367_utt_DAIC_95 um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can
367_utt_DAIC_96 lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much
367_utt_DAIC_97 try to it when i'm upset
367_utt_DAIC_98 i i get upset with myself not with other people
367_utt_DAIC_99 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
367_utt_DAIC_100 um
367_utt_DAIC_101 last night i guess well <weh> um
367_utt_DAIC_102 i got in an argument about whether or not
367_utt_DAIC_103 cleaning vegetables was necessary because of
367_utt_DAIC_104 i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay
367_utt_DAIC_105 so it turned into this
367_utt_DAIC_106 big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i
367_utt_DAIC_107 wild_laughter5 ((laughter))
367_utt_DAIC_108 i ended up being wrong on that one but
367_utt_DAIC_109 it is
367_utt_DAIC_110 yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument
367_utt_DAIC_111 okay_confirm (okay)
367_utt_DAIC_112 feelguilty (what's something you feel guilty about)
367_utt_DAIC_113 um
367_utt_DAIC_114 uh
367_utt_DAIC_115 a lot so much um
367_utt_DAIC_116 uh
367_utt_DAIC_117 i
367_utt_DAIC_118 i
367_utt_DAIC_119 i was in uh a relationship that i really really
367_utt_DAIC_120 um
367_utt_DAIC_121 that i really wanted to work
367_utt_DAIC_122 and
367_utt_DAIC_123 uh
367_utt_DAIC_124 i ended up and it was partly due to
367_utt_DAIC_125 i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going
367_utt_DAIC_126 at like everything sort of spiraled out of
367_utt_DAIC_127 control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't
367_utt_DAIC_128 i wasn't mean but i was
367_utt_DAIC_129 but i was getting more and more messed up
367_utt_DAIC_130 and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not
367_utt_DAIC_131 and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again
367_utt_DAIC_132 so
367_utt_DAIC_133 that was pretty that was pretty tough
367_utt_DAIC_134 hmm_downer (hmm)
367_utt_DAIC_135 avoid (could you have done anything to avoid it)
367_utt_DAIC_136 well some of it was was that
367_utt_DAIC_137 i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's
367_utt_DAIC_138 completely kind of i mean i still get
367_utt_DAIC_139 i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not
367_utt_DAIC_140 i don't completely lose it for days at a time
367_utt_DAIC_141 um
367_utt_DAIC_142 so
367_utt_DAIC_143 i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then
367_utt_DAIC_144 i would've i would i would be
367_utt_DAIC_145 i would be
367_utt_DAIC_146 it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have
367_utt_DAIC_147 i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different
367_utt_DAIC_148 yeah_downer (yeah)
367_utt_DAIC_149 things being how they were
367_utt_DAIC_150 too_hard (do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself)
367_utt_DAIC_151 i mean it's
367_utt_DAIC_152 it's possible uh
367_utt_DAIC_153 i mean obviously
367_utt_DAIC_154 yeah because i mean that's what i do i i
367_utt_DAIC_155 take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until
367_utt_DAIC_156 until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff
367_utt_DAIC_157 um
367_utt_DAIC_158 and it's like any little detail that comes up
367_utt_DAIC_159 i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still
367_utt_DAIC_160 i still get
367_utt_DAIC_161 i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school
367_utt_DAIC_162 which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there
367_utt_DAIC_163 yeah_downer (yeah)
367_utt_DAIC_164 been_hard (that sounds really hard)
367_utt_DAIC_165 well it's it's not
367_utt_DAIC_166 easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by
367_utt_DAIC_167 by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way
367_utt_DAIC_168 um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better
367_utt_DAIC_169 Ellie17Dec2012_03 (that's good)
367_utt_DAIC_170 symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
367_utt_DAIC_171 um well like i said i do a lot of
367_utt_DAIC_172 you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost
367_utt_DAIC_173 be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely
367_utt_DAIC_174 um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be
367_utt_DAIC_175 you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just
367_utt_DAIC_176 keep my mind occupied during all of that
367_utt_DAIC_177 um
367_utt_DAIC_178 mhm (mhm)
367_utt_DAIC_179 i just need i mean
367_utt_DAIC_180 i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet
367_utt_DAIC_181 trigger (are they triggered by something)
367_utt_DAIC_182 they're triggered by everything
367_utt_DAIC_183 pretty much anything that i that i see if i
367_utt_DAIC_184 if i
367_utt_DAIC_185 if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about
367_utt_DAIC_186 just
367_utt_DAIC_187 anything you know i can reach back and connect
367_utt_DAIC_188 to
367_utt_DAIC_189 to this it's really it's really
367_utt_DAIC_190 i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break
367_utt_DAIC_191 from it
367_utt_DAIC_192 that_sucks (that sucks)
367_utt_DAIC_193 yeah
367_utt_DAIC_194 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
367_utt_DAIC_195 um
367_utt_DAIC_196 i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i
367_utt_DAIC_197 awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally
367_utt_DAIC_198 you know don't
367_utt_DAIC_199 i don't know i never really needed much sleep so
367_utt_DAIC_200 it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep
367_utt_DAIC_201 like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work
367_utt_DAIC_202 um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly
367_utt_DAIC_203 you know i get up i toss and turn all night
367_utt_DAIC_204 you know and now
367_utt_DAIC_205 it's just
367_utt_DAIC_206 it's
367_utt_DAIC_207 yeah i don't sleep too great right now
367_utt_DAIC_208 mhm (mhm)
367_utt_DAIC_209 sleep_affects (what are you like when you don't sleep well)
367_utt_DAIC_210 um
367_utt_DAIC_211 pretty i mean
367_utt_DAIC_212 i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i
367_utt_DAIC_213 i usually just kind of power through it and just
367_utt_DAIC_214 i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel
367_utt_DAIC_215 bad
367_utt_DAIC_216 okay_confirm (okay)
367_utt_DAIC_217 when_diagnosed (how long ago were you diagnosed)
367_utt_DAIC_218 um
367_utt_DAIC_219 i think
367_utt_DAIC_220 about three three four years ago
367_utt_DAIC_221 um
367_utt_DAIC_222 it was when i
367_utt_DAIC_223 i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for
367_utt_DAIC_224 for
367_utt_DAIC_225 years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got
367_utt_DAIC_226 this
367_utt_DAIC_227 situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like
367_utt_DAIC_228 even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so
367_utt_DAIC_229 so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately
367_utt_DAIC_230 it happened after everything uh went bad so
367_utt_DAIC_231 i don't know
367_utt_DAIC_232 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
367_utt_DAIC_233 in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel
367_utt_DAIC_234 it really makes me
367_utt_DAIC_235 angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm
367_utt_DAIC_236 that i had to that i i lost everything because
367_utt_DAIC_237 because of
367_utt_DAIC_238 chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control
367_utt_DAIC_239 and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't
367_utt_DAIC_240 it was it didn't help it didn't work until
367_utt_DAIC_241 until
367_utt_DAIC_242 you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but
367_utt_DAIC_243 it was a little it's a little late now
367_utt_DAIC_244 yeah_downer (yeah)
367_utt_DAIC_245 why_seek_help (what got you to seek help)
367_utt_DAIC_246 um
367_utt_DAIC_247 there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was
367_utt_DAIC_248 it was either
367_utt_DAIC_249 i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different
367_utt_DAIC_250 but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after
367_utt_DAIC_251 after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off
367_utt_DAIC_252 but it was at least
367_utt_DAIC_253 that and not
367_utt_DAIC_254 firing me
367_utt_DAIC_255 but but but yeah but so i got help but it was
367_utt_DAIC_256 but it wasn't soon enough
367_utt_DAIC_257 downer (okay)
367_utt_DAIC_258 therapy_going (do you still go to therapy now)
367_utt_DAIC_259 uh not
367_utt_DAIC_260 not as much as i should
367_utt_DAIC_261 um
367_utt_DAIC_262 i go to a couple of
367_utt_DAIC_263 meetings
367_utt_DAIC_264 i go to i go to a_a so that i can
367_utt_DAIC_265 um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that
367_utt_DAIC_266 um unfortunately you know being unemployed
367_utt_DAIC_267 my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so
367_utt_DAIC_268 you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing
367_utt_DAIC_269 somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really
367_utt_DAIC_270 very
367_utt_DAIC_271 i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so
367_utt_DAIC_272 it's basically to keep my medication coming
367_utt_DAIC_273 okay_confirm (okay)
367_utt_DAIC_274 and then there's you <laughter>
367_utt_DAIC_275 wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
367_utt_DAIC_276 yeah3 (yeah)
367_utt_DAIC_277 right
367_utt_DAIC_278 therapy_changes (what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy)
367_utt_DAIC_279 well like i said i mean
367_utt_DAIC_280 just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now
367_utt_DAIC_281 um just saying stuff outloud is just
367_utt_DAIC_282 like getting getting this stuff out
367_utt_DAIC_283 trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense
367_utt_DAIC_284 that you can actually deal with
367_utt_DAIC_285 is a big step like
367_utt_DAIC_286 regardless of who
367_utt_DAIC_287 you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that
367_utt_DAIC_288 stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can
367_utt_DAIC_289 talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing
367_utt_DAIC_290 right2 (right)
367_utt_DAIC_291 yeah
367_utt_DAIC_292 feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
367_utt_DAIC_293 um
367_utt_DAIC_294 you know better than i than i have been um i mean
367_utt_DAIC_295 it it sort of
367_utt_DAIC_296 it goes <g> it has its ups and downs
367_utt_DAIC_297 um you know i'm applying for jobs
367_utt_DAIC_298 five six jobs
367_utt_DAIC_299 or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview
367_utt_DAIC_300 never even getting close to
367_utt_DAIC_301 to to being self sufficient again
367_utt_DAIC_302 um
367_utt_DAIC_303 it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control
367_utt_DAIC_304 so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is
367_utt_DAIC_305 it just has its it's just its own own challenge
367_utt_DAIC_306 yeah3 (yeah)
367_utt_DAIC_307 good_job (it can be tough to find a good job these days)
367_utt_DAIC_308 yeah
367_utt_DAIC_309 happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
367_utt_DAIC_310 um
367_utt_DAIC_311 it was probably you know a couple years ago
367_utt_DAIC_312 um
367_utt_DAIC_313 i i was
367_utt_DAIC_314 i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind
367_utt_DAIC_315 uh
367_utt_DAIC_316 is
367_utt_DAIC_317 everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close
367_utt_DAIC_318 we were having fun together
367_utt_DAIC_319 and we went out and got a christmas tree
367_utt_DAIC_320 and
367_utt_DAIC_321 we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just
367_utt_DAIC_322 feeling like a part of somebody's life
367_utt_DAIC_323 and feeling like a part of the bigger
367_utt_DAIC_324 the bigger life
367_utt_DAIC_325 that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel
367_utt_DAIC_326 you know for that instant i felt like
367_utt_DAIC_327 a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and
367_utt_DAIC_328 you know everything was going really well and
367_utt_DAIC_329 i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person
367_utt_DAIC_330 a normal happy person
367_utt_DAIC_331 and
367_utt_DAIC_332 part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that
367_utt_DAIC_333 i don't know if i'll ever feel that again
367_utt_DAIC_334 so
367_utt_DAIC_335 uh_huh (uh huh)

367_utt_DAIC_339 probably this
367_utt_DAIC_340 educational <educary> educational series i did uh
367_utt_DAIC_341 an educational
367_utt_DAIC_342 uh video series i did for the national science foundation
367_utt_DAIC_343 um
367_utt_DAIC_344 it was
367_utt_DAIC_345 it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and
367_utt_DAIC_346 you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um
367_utt_DAIC_347 and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to
367_utt_DAIC_348 the world
367_utt_DAIC_349 mhm (mhm)
367_utt_DAIC_350 sounds_interesting (that sounds interesting)

367_utt_DAIC_352 oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um
367_utt_DAIC_353 it was it was a
367_utt_DAIC_354 we were trying to come up with
367_utt_DAIC_355 with new ideas uh
367_utt_DAIC_356 for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know
367_utt_DAIC_357 to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big
367_utt_DAIC_358 you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um
367_utt_DAIC_359 and there was a lot to it and so
367_utt_DAIC_360 it was probably the biggest
367_utt_DAIC_361 project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it
367_utt_DAIC_362 right that doesn't yeah

377_utt_DAIC_40 i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but
377_utt_DAIC_41 you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um
377_utt_DAIC_42 and
377_utt_DAIC_43 yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh
377_utt_DAIC_44 yeah
377_utt_DAIC_45 so
377_utt_DAIC_46 yeah3 (yeah)
377_utt_DAIC_47 yeah3 (yeah)

377_utt_DAIC_64 i'm trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but
377_utt_DAIC_65 morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh

377_utt_DAIC_69 um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so
377_utt_DAIC_70 my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was
377_utt_DAIC_71 um being on a bus and and leaving
377_utt_DAIC_72 um dublin and going just out to the countryside and
377_utt_DAIC_73 seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but
377_utt_DAIC_74 when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible

377_utt_DAIC_85 comes into play and eh so does my
377_utt_DAIC_86 i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach

377_utt_DAIC_121 um
377_utt_DAIC_122 i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so
377_utt_DAIC_123 yeah
377_utt_DAIC_124 mhm (mhm)

377_utt_DAIC_132 i love to read
377_utt_DAIC_133 i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions
377_utt_DAIC_134 that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else
377_utt_DAIC_135 um
377_utt_DAIC_136 i like to be with friends um
377_utt_DAIC_137 i love art and
377_utt_DAIC_138 trying new restaurants um
377_utt_DAIC_139 yeah all those things are
377_utt_DAIC_140 both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that
377_utt_DAIC_141 um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so
377_utt_DAIC_142 uh_huh (uh huh)
377_utt_DAIC_143 yeah yeah
377_utt_DAIC_144 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
377_utt_DAIC_145 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)

377_utt_DAIC_147 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
377_utt_DAIC_148 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
377_utt_DAIC_149 um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be
377_utt_DAIC_150 oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery
377_utt_DAIC_151 yeah that was the last time so
377_utt_DAIC_152 tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
377_utt_DAIC_153 yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of
377_utt_DAIC_154 uh it didn't show up
377_utt_DAIC_155 and
377_utt_DAIC_156 uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until
377_utt_DAIC_157 um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and
377_utt_DAIC_158 they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place
377_utt_DAIC_159 so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that
377_utt_DAIC_160 the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so
377_utt_DAIC_161 i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated
377_utt_DAIC_162 yeah_downer (yeah)
377_utt_DAIC_163 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
377_utt_DAIC_164 oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um
377_utt_DAIC_165 let me think about one
377_utt_DAIC_166 um the other day i had a phone call
377_utt_DAIC_167 and i'm in a coaching program and
377_utt_DAIC_168 it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program
377_utt_DAIC_169 and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with
377_utt_DAIC_170 and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with
377_utt_DAIC_171 um
377_utt_DAIC_172 someone who's not my coach and uh that
377_utt_DAIC_173 hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these
377_utt_DAIC_174 people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to
377_utt_DAIC_175 not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know
377_utt_DAIC_176 so
377_utt_DAIC_177 yeah i wasn't um
377_utt_DAIC_178 i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and
377_utt_DAIC_179 it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but
377_utt_DAIC_180 um
377_utt_DAIC_181 yeah i could've
377_utt_DAIC_182 certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and
377_utt_DAIC_183 would've made the call go a lot smoother
377_utt_DAIC_184 uh_huh (uh huh)
377_utt_DAIC_185 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
377_utt_DAIC_186 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
377_utt_DAIC_187 hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few
377_utt_DAIC_188 i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision
377_utt_DAIC_189 no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was
377_utt_DAIC_190 challenging
377_utt_DAIC_191 um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i
377_utt_DAIC_192 moved
377_utt_DAIC_193 uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado
377_utt_DAIC_194 and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been
377_utt_DAIC_195 you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know
377_utt_DAIC_196 um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging
377_utt_DAIC_197 change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
377_utt_DAIC_198 change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
377_utt_DAIC_199 oh lots of things um
377_utt_DAIC_200 i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and
377_utt_DAIC_201 the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um
377_utt_DAIC_202 at the time i was very much into rock climbing
377_utt_DAIC_203 and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were
377_utt_DAIC_204 um in my age group and or single that was another factor um
377_utt_DAIC_205 and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit
377_utt_DAIC_206 so
377_utt_DAIC_207 yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but
377_utt_DAIC_208 um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move
377_utt_DAIC_209 great_situation (that sounds like a great situation)
377_utt_DAIC_210 great_situation (that sounds like a great situation)
377_utt_DAIC_211 yeah
377_utt_DAIC_212 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
377_utt_DAIC_213 uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>
377_utt_DAIC_214 relatively easily
377_utt_DAIC_215 it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then
377_utt_DAIC_216 you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today
377_utt_DAIC_217 but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty
377_utt_DAIC_218 anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um
377_utt_DAIC_219 but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily
377_utt_DAIC_220 trigger (are they triggered by something)
377_utt_DAIC_221 um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of
377_utt_DAIC_222 out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um
377_utt_DAIC_223 yeah and i just i have to find
377_utt_DAIC_224 the financial means to support me in doing that and it's
377_utt_DAIC_225 and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing
377_utt_DAIC_226 so
377_utt_DAIC_227 yeah
377_utt_DAIC_228 difficult (how hard is that)
377_utt_DAIC_229 difficult (how hard is that)
377_utt_DAIC_230 um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation
377_utt_DAIC_231 isee_downer (i see)

413_utt_DAIC_61 yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is

413_utt_DAIC_64 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
413_utt_DAIC_65 um i consider myself more shy

413_utt_DAIC_81 well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like
413_utt_DAIC_82 insignificant things

413_utt_DAIC_85 tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
413_utt_DAIC_86 um
413_utt_DAIC_87 there's been like some tension going on
413_utt_DAIC_88 since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter
413_utt_DAIC_89 things about his girlfriend and
413_utt_DAIC_90 he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to
413_utt_DAIC_91 have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways
413_utt_DAIC_92 so for like the thirtieth time he
413_utt_DAIC_93 we were on the phone and he was
413_utt_DAIC_94 <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and
413_utt_DAIC_95 he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i
413_utt_DAIC_96 i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me

413_utt_DAIC_101 i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish
413_utt_DAIC_102 that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue
413_utt_DAIC_103 but the thing is is that he says
413_utt_DAIC_104 certain things that are untrue
413_utt_DAIC_105 or things he knows that like will tick me off
413_utt_DAIC_106 that are really nasty and
413_utt_DAIC_107 that he shouldn't be saying to me so he
413_utt_DAIC_108 so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really
413_utt_DAIC_109 mm like not say anything

413_utt_DAIC_111 im_sorry (i'm sorry)

413_utt_DAIC_113 um
413_utt_DAIC_114 well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't
413_utt_DAIC_115 i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to
413_utt_DAIC_116 after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically
413_utt_DAIC_117 changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own
413_utt_DAIC_118 so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now
413_utt_DAIC_119 that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made
413_utt_DAIC_120 okay_confirm (okay)

413_utt_DAIC_124 the event or seeing
413_utt_DAIC_125 my grandmother's funeral which
413_utt_DAIC_126 obviously it wouldn't change anything
413_utt_DAIC_127 but
413_utt_DAIC_128 it wasn't
413_utt_DAIC_129 seeing her there was not something i'd wanna
413_utt_DAIC_130 like have in my memory
413_utt_DAIC_131 yeah_downer (yeah)
413_utt_DAIC_132 influence_positive (who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life)

413_utt_DAIC_204 being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and
413_utt_DAIC_205 the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here
413_utt_DAIC_206 so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or
413_utt_DAIC_207 you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even
413_utt_DAIC_208 that it was more like a transfer school like you
413_utt_DAIC_209 you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went
413_utt_DAIC_210 yeah_downer (yeah)

413_utt_DAIC_215 i would give myself the advice to
413_utt_DAIC_216 probably stay closer to home
413_utt_DAIC_217 and to have
413_utt_DAIC_218 really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california

417_utt_DAIC_19 i think that it's a really important job um
417_utt_DAIC_20 uh i feel like
417_utt_DAIC_21 uh because there's kind of uh
417_utt_DAIC_22 stigma i guess about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies
417_utt_DAIC_23 so i feel like it's a very important job for
417_utt_DAIC_24 the world <laughter>
417_utt_DAIC_25 yeah_downer (yeah)
417_utt_DAIC_26 difficult (how hard is that)

417_utt_DAIC_36 uh of course with people who i know well
417_utt_DAIC_37 like they're closer to me i i'm more outgoing
417_utt_DAIC_38 mhm (mhm)

417_utt_DAIC_59 but regret is like
417_utt_DAIC_60 um feeling like you should've made a different decision and
417_utt_DAIC_61 i think that can help you in

422_utt_DAIC_85 ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian
422_utt_DAIC_86 but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and
422_utt_DAIC_87 in in a veterinary capacity
422_utt_DAIC_88 yeah
422_utt_DAIC_89 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
422_utt_DAIC_90 i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and
422_utt_DAIC_91 how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not
422_utt_DAIC_92 makes_sense (that makes sense)
422_utt_DAIC_93 yeah
422_utt_DAIC_94 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)

422_utt_DAIC_97 uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping
422_utt_DAIC_98 um
422_utt_DAIC_99 i like
422_utt_DAIC_100 like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand
422_utt_DAIC_101 or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or
422_utt_DAIC_102 a lotta times i can just lay there and
422_utt_DAIC_103 my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing
422_utt_DAIC_104 uh_huh (uh huh)
422_utt_DAIC_105 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
422_utt_DAIC_106 ah really good
422_utt_DAIC_107 i don't have
422_utt_DAIC_108 i would say there's certain things that um
422_utt_DAIC_109 they can really
422_utt_DAIC_110 like make me
422_utt_DAIC_111 like when i see injustices or things like that then
422_utt_DAIC_112 i mean i can really feel it
422_utt_DAIC_113 but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or
422_utt_DAIC_114 uh even you know yell <laughter>
422_utt_DAIC_115 thats_good (that's good)
422_utt_DAIC_116 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
422_utt_DAIC_117 <sigh>
422_utt_DAIC_118 argued
422_utt_DAIC_119 um <sigh>
422_utt_DAIC_120 i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument
422_utt_DAIC_121 like if we just
422_utt_DAIC_122 mind (whatever comes to your mind)
422_utt_DAIC_123 well
422_utt_DAIC_124 uh i would say last summer
422_utt_DAIC_125 when
422_utt_DAIC_126 um
422_utt_DAIC_127 i think it was after a
422_utt_DAIC_128 baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to
422_utt_DAIC_129 we went to have shabu shabu after the game
422_utt_DAIC_130 and
422_utt_DAIC_131 i don't know i think
422_utt_DAIC_132 scrubbed_entry
422_utt_DAIC_133 and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like
422_utt_DAIC_134 mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her
422_utt_DAIC_135 um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any
422_utt_DAIC_136 deep problems but um
422_utt_DAIC_137 sometimes we just have
422_utt_DAIC_138 she's very touchy
422_utt_DAIC_139 and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do
422_utt_DAIC_140 so i think
422_utt_DAIC_141 she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm
422_utt_DAIC_142 you know i just kinda
422_utt_DAIC_143 that's just how she is
422_utt_DAIC_144 and then i guess i said some things that she
422_utt_DAIC_145 felt were
422_utt_DAIC_146 eh well she gets really
422_utt_DAIC_147 offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we
422_utt_DAIC_148 then one day she called me up and then we were friends again
422_utt_DAIC_149 okay_confirm (okay)
422_utt_DAIC_150 but like she never she never confronted me
422_utt_DAIC_151 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
422_utt_DAIC_152 hardest decision <sigh>
422_utt_DAIC_153 uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend
422_utt_DAIC_154 hard_decision (how did you decide to do that)
422_utt_DAIC_155 uh well
422_utt_DAIC_156 it wasn't
422_utt_DAIC_157 <sigh>
422_utt_DAIC_158 it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it
422_utt_DAIC_159 for like five years
422_utt_DAIC_160 um
422_utt_DAIC_161 you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just
422_utt_DAIC_162 had a lot of um
422_utt_DAIC_163 we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements
422_utt_DAIC_164 so i had thought about it and thought about it and
422_utt_DAIC_165 we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so
422_utt_DAIC_166 i don't know uh
422_utt_DAIC_167 i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally
422_utt_DAIC_168 eh we were just always having
422_utt_DAIC_169 um
422_utt_DAIC_170 we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um
422_utt_DAIC_171 we were just having these little snippy
422_utt_DAIC_172 disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and
422_utt_DAIC_173 um i did
422_utt_DAIC_174 been_hard (that sounds really hard)
422_utt_DAIC_175 it was really hard it was it was the hardest
422_utt_DAIC_176 decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um
422_utt_DAIC_177 and
422_utt_DAIC_178 but i i think it was for the best
422_utt_DAIC_179 Ellie17Dec2012_03 (that's good)
422_utt_DAIC_180 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
422_utt_DAIC_181 <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job
422_utt_DAIC_182 for well to help my friend start a business in nevada
422_utt_DAIC_183 and when i when i
422_utt_DAIC_184 i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach
422_utt_DAIC_185 and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome
422_utt_DAIC_186 and that was really stressful for me because um
422_utt_DAIC_187 i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't
422_utt_DAIC_188 for her wanting me to come over there um
422_utt_DAIC_189 it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left
422_utt_DAIC_190 and um
422_utt_DAIC_191 when i went over there
422_utt_DAIC_192 like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah
422_utt_DAIC_193 when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and
422_utt_DAIC_194 the other principals of the company were um
422_utt_DAIC_195 you know the <th>
422_utt_DAIC_196 it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much
422_utt_DAIC_197 and also
422_utt_DAIC_198 they were a different religion
422_utt_DAIC_199 and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh
422_utt_DAIC_200 wild_laughter5 ((laughter))
422_utt_DAIC_201 eh i was kind of an outsider there and then
422_utt_DAIC_202 also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>
422_utt_DAIC_203 so i would say that's one decision it it's
422_utt_DAIC_204 it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um
422_utt_DAIC_205 i really wish i i had just stayed
422_utt_DAIC_206 yeah_downer (yeah)
422_utt_DAIC_207 memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
422_utt_DAIC_208 <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say
422_utt_DAIC_209 <sigh>
422_utt_DAIC_210 my memory
422_utt_DAIC_211 like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase
422_utt_DAIC_212 is that what you're saying
422_utt_DAIC_213 uh_huh (uh huh)
422_utt_DAIC_214 mm <sigh>
422_utt_DAIC_215 can't really think of anything i mean
422_utt_DAIC_216 even like that
422_utt_DAIC_217 that bad decision that i made
422_utt_DAIC_218 you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something
422_utt_DAIC_219 mm (mm)
422_utt_DAIC_220 and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't
422_utt_DAIC_221 yeah_downer (yeah)
422_utt_DAIC_222 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)

422_utt_DAIC_233 and rested but they're short-lived
422_utt_DAIC_234 but i sleep a lot i sleep

422_utt_DAIC_256 my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down
422_utt_DAIC_257 um
422_utt_DAIC_258 i would say that i do feel down sometimes
422_utt_DAIC_259 a lotta times but it's not
422_utt_DAIC_260 i would say
422_utt_DAIC_261 it's reasonable considering
422_utt_DAIC_262 the situations that i'm in
422_utt_DAIC_263 downer (okay)
422_utt_DAIC_264 trigger (are they triggered by something)
422_utt_DAIC_265 uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult

422_utt_DAIC_289 probably um
422_utt_DAIC_290 o_c_d <laughter> and um
422_utt_DAIC_291 she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her
422_utt_DAIC_292 um
422_utt_DAIC_293 i think that she would
422_utt_DAIC_294 say that i have a good heart um we're very different
422_utt_DAIC_295 um
422_utt_DAIC_296 and probably that i'm
422_utt_DAIC_297 <sigh>
422_utt_DAIC_298 i should ask her <laughter> uh
422_utt_DAIC_299 i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun
422_utt_DAIC_300 um but
422_utt_DAIC_301 she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that
422_utt_DAIC_302 why2 (why)
422_utt_DAIC_303 why um
422_utt_DAIC_304 <sigh>
422_utt_DAIC_305 i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now
422_utt_DAIC_306 and <sigh>
422_utt_DAIC_307 so i don't really
422_utt_DAIC_308 tell people about them
422_utt_DAIC_309 um
422_utt_DAIC_310 it it's kind of a
422_utt_DAIC_311 it's kind of a killjoy but also
422_utt_DAIC_312 people can feel i feel that people can feel
422_utt_DAIC_313 less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of
422_utt_DAIC_314 um
422_utt_DAIC_315 it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before
422_utt_DAIC_316 even before this difficult time in my life i've been
422_utt_DAIC_317 i've been a private person i don't know why
422_utt_DAIC_318 i think <thi> i think a lot
422_utt_DAIC_319 eh you know i'm a deep thinker
422_utt_DAIC_320 and
422_utt_DAIC_321 maybe it's just
422_utt_DAIC_322 you know
422_utt_DAIC_323 not like i feels like i feel abnormal but
422_utt_DAIC_324 um
422_utt_DAIC_325 maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that
422_utt_DAIC_326 don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure

439_utt_DAIC_76 and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you
439_utt_DAIC_77 and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you
439_utt_DAIC_78 you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door
439_utt_DAIC_79 that you care

439_utt_DAIC_86 parent_best (what's the best thing about being a parent)
439_utt_DAIC_87 uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you
439_utt_DAIC_88 and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son
439_utt_DAIC_89 and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home
439_utt_DAIC_90 on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey
439_utt_DAIC_91 i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads

439_utt_DAIC_95 parent_differences (what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents)
439_utt_DAIC_96 um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um
439_utt_DAIC_97 for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls
439_utt_DAIC_98 so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel
439_utt_DAIC_99 and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they
439_utt_DAIC_100 found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one
439_utt_DAIC_101 and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel
439_utt_DAIC_102 so i've made up for her
439_utt_DAIC_103 and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there
439_utt_DAIC_104 i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly
439_utt_DAIC_105 so i made up for it
439_utt_DAIC_106 okay_confirm (okay)
439_utt_DAIC_107 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
439_utt_DAIC_108 i think before i speak
439_utt_DAIC_109 and then i am the type of person also to um
439_utt_DAIC_110 i take on other people's feelings before i um
439_utt_DAIC_111 blurt out the wrong thing i try to
439_utt_DAIC_112 uh analyze the situation first
439_utt_DAIC_113 before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of
439_utt_DAIC_114 yeah2 (yeah)
439_utt_DAIC_115 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
439_utt_DAIC_116 um
439_utt_DAIC_117 <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house
439_utt_DAIC_118 uh we had a disagreement on that um
439_utt_DAIC_119 men have their own way of doing things and um
439_utt_DAIC_120 i had told him not to use a certain uh
439_utt_DAIC_121 eh person to work on our house
439_utt_DAIC_122 but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead
439_utt_DAIC_123 and now he sees all the downfalls
439_utt_DAIC_124 and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so
439_utt_DAIC_125 but i guess he can tell by my facial expression
439_utt_DAIC_126 that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money
439_utt_DAIC_127 and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong
439_utt_DAIC_128 and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project
439_utt_DAIC_129 so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um
439_utt_DAIC_130 that i can think of that's recent
439_utt_DAIC_131 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
439_utt_DAIC_132 i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me
439_utt_DAIC_133 and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um
439_utt_DAIC_134 you need to do your research
439_utt_DAIC_135 i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's
439_utt_DAIC_136 but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money
439_utt_DAIC_137 and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed
439_utt_DAIC_138 he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>
439_utt_DAIC_139 right2 (right)
439_utt_DAIC_140 which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money
439_utt_DAIC_141 and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because
439_utt_DAIC_142 that_sucks (that sucks)
439_utt_DAIC_143 it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again
439_utt_DAIC_144 yeah_downer (yeah)
439_utt_DAIC_145 and it didn't make any sense
439_utt_DAIC_146 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
439_utt_DAIC_147 um
439_utt_DAIC_148 i retired early
439_utt_DAIC_149 um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california
439_utt_DAIC_150 um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen
439_utt_DAIC_151 and i had like thirty one and a half years of service
439_utt_DAIC_152 and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance
439_utt_DAIC_153 so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but
439_utt_DAIC_154 um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long
439_utt_DAIC_155 um
439_utt_DAIC_156 i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay
439_utt_DAIC_157 um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job
439_utt_DAIC_158 because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um
439_utt_DAIC_159 i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up
439_utt_DAIC_160 and i don't i pay very little money
439_utt_DAIC_161 so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive
439_utt_DAIC_162 yeah3 (yeah)
439_utt_DAIC_163 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
439_utt_DAIC_164 um
439_utt_DAIC_165 let me see the hardest
439_utt_DAIC_166 it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying
439_utt_DAIC_167 and my mother um
439_utt_DAIC_168 died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma
439_utt_DAIC_169 and
439_utt_DAIC_170 i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying
439_utt_DAIC_171 or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me
439_utt_DAIC_172 and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx
439_utt_DAIC_173 and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order
439_utt_DAIC_174 and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things
439_utt_DAIC_175 you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and
439_utt_DAIC_176 i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff
439_utt_DAIC_177 and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting
439_utt_DAIC_178 she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had
439_utt_DAIC_179 a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything
439_utt_DAIC_180 been_hard (that sounds really hard)
439_utt_DAIC_181 yeah it was it was but
439_utt_DAIC_182 and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um
439_utt_DAIC_183 since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children
439_utt_DAIC_184 that my husband and i we got together
439_utt_DAIC_185 and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um
439_utt_DAIC_186 what do you call the um
439_utt_DAIC_187 barrel insurance we had that
439_utt_DAIC_188 and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything
439_utt_DAIC_189 and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird
439_utt_DAIC_190 so
439_utt_DAIC_191 my son
439_utt_DAIC_192 make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what
439_utt_DAIC_193 i went through
439_utt_DAIC_194 and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on
439_utt_DAIC_195 makes_sense (that makes sense)
439_utt_DAIC_196 and um
439_utt_DAIC_197 he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust
439_utt_DAIC_198 i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call
439_utt_DAIC_199 mhm (mhm)
439_utt_DAIC_200 and that's it
439_utt_DAIC_201 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)

440_utt_DAIC_43 memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences)
440_utt_DAIC_44 um <clears throat>
440_utt_DAIC_45 that would be
440_utt_DAIC_46 um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house
440_utt_DAIC_47 in the midst of
440_utt_DAIC_48 acres and acres and acres of grapes was just
440_utt_DAIC_49 magnificent
440_utt_DAIC_50 wow (wow)

440_utt_DAIC_52 um human development
440_utt_DAIC_53 hard_decision (how did you decide to do that)
440_utt_DAIC_54 um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i
440_utt_DAIC_55 started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant
440_utt_DAIC_56 and um i went to a program
440_utt_DAIC_57 in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant
440_utt_DAIC_58 and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss
440_utt_DAIC_59 i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly
440_utt_DAIC_60 and um so the college offered
440_utt_DAIC_61 human development as a major
440_utt_DAIC_62 and i um
440_utt_DAIC_63 just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired
440_utt_DAIC_64 towards that particular major and
440_utt_DAIC_65 and i'm happy with it
440_utt_DAIC_66 thats_good (that's good)
440_utt_DAIC_67 still_working_on_X (are you still working in that)
440_utt_DAIC_68 um currently no i stay at home i have a little one

440_utt_DAIC_78 no
440_utt_DAIC_79 parent_best (what's the best thing about being a parent)
440_utt_DAIC_80 um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional
440_utt_DAIC_81 parent_hardest (what's the hardest thing about being a parent)
440_utt_DAIC_82 all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time
440_utt_DAIC_83 for every age <laughter>
440_utt_DAIC_84 and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages
440_utt_DAIC_85 like_what (like what)
440_utt_DAIC_86 so
440_utt_DAIC_87 yeah3 (yeah)
440_utt_DAIC_88 parent_differences (what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents)
440_utt_DAIC_89 um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages
440_utt_DAIC_90 that's why it makes me crazy
440_utt_DAIC_91 um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents
440_utt_DAIC_92 it was just kinda like
440_utt_DAIC_93 you know is she fed is she dressed
440_utt_DAIC_94 she has a house i mean a roof over her head
440_utt_DAIC_95 and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so
440_utt_DAIC_96 it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of
440_utt_DAIC_97 that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age
440_utt_DAIC_98 every year month
440_utt_DAIC_99 you know <clears throat> and um

440_utt_DAIC_128 when i'm upset
440_utt_DAIC_129 um which is not good
440_utt_DAIC_130 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out
440_utt_DAIC_131 and um
440_utt_DAIC_132 yeah that

440_utt_DAIC_138 um
440_utt_DAIC_139 he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage
440_utt_DAIC_140 on him
440_utt_DAIC_141 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
440_utt_DAIC_142 uh really tired of talking about that same topic
440_utt_DAIC_143 tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
440_utt_DAIC_144 um
440_utt_DAIC_145 well it came it spawned from <f> from
440_utt_DAIC_146 a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for
440_utt_DAIC_147 many things
440_utt_DAIC_148 and um <clears throat>
440_utt_DAIC_149 and so he took that information and came home
440_utt_DAIC_150 and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me
440_utt_DAIC_151 think about cheating and
440_utt_DAIC_152 he knows that i've been resentful of him
440_utt_DAIC_153 and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating
440_utt_DAIC_154 <clears throat> and um <sigh>
440_utt_DAIC_155 i we've had this conversation a lot of times
440_utt_DAIC_156 and uh i mean not just that but
440_utt_DAIC_157 i don't know just about cheating in general
440_utt_DAIC_158 and um so i just said what i
440_utt_DAIC_159 normally said normally say is that i haven't
440_utt_DAIC_160 um
440_utt_DAIC_161 cheated and that i
440_utt_DAIC_162 did think about that when we were first together
440_utt_DAIC_163 and uh but it was just a mere thought
440_utt_DAIC_164 and
440_utt_DAIC_165 um
440_utt_DAIC_166 and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another
440_utt_DAIC_167 and that just kinda
440_utt_DAIC_168 <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that
440_utt_DAIC_169 and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again
440_utt_DAIC_170 and why are we having this conversation <laughter>
440_utt_DAIC_171 are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that
440_utt_DAIC_172 that
440_utt_DAIC_173 went into
440_utt_DAIC_174 that um
440_utt_DAIC_175 argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting
440_utt_DAIC_176 been_hard (that sounds really hard)
440_utt_DAIC_177 symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
440_utt_DAIC_178 um <sigh>
440_utt_DAIC_179 not talking
440_utt_DAIC_180 at all <laughter>
440_utt_DAIC_181 okay_confirm (okay)
440_utt_DAIC_182 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
440_utt_DAIC_183 um <sigh>
440_utt_DAIC_184 mm
440_utt_DAIC_185 pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled
440_utt_DAIC_186 because i really don't like
440_utt_DAIC_187 if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because
440_utt_DAIC_188 um i was yelled at
440_utt_DAIC_189 a lot
440_utt_DAIC_190 and i just
440_utt_DAIC_191 feel bad about that and i
440_utt_DAIC_192 try really hard to not
440_utt_DAIC_193 handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get
440_utt_DAIC_194 and result in in yelling
440_utt_DAIC_195 okay_confirm (okay)
440_utt_DAIC_196 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
440_utt_DAIC_197 hmm
440_utt_DAIC_198 that would probably be whether to keep
440_utt_DAIC_199 a pregnancy or not
440_utt_DAIC_200 tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
440_utt_DAIC_201 yeah
440_utt_DAIC_202 yeah i um
440_utt_DAIC_203 i was just talking about it yesterday actually
440_utt_DAIC_204 and um
440_utt_DAIC_205 oh i was pregnant and
440_utt_DAIC_206 i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married
440_utt_DAIC_207 and but i just
440_utt_DAIC_208 didn't think that i it was the right time for me
440_utt_DAIC_209 and um
440_utt_DAIC_210 i had
440_utt_DAIC_211 pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy
440_utt_DAIC_212 but i made the decision by myself
440_utt_DAIC_213 and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant
440_utt_DAIC_214 he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me
440_utt_DAIC_215 and so that decision was quite hard
440_utt_DAIC_216 because i felt obligated to do so
440_utt_DAIC_217 and felt super guilty to not
440_utt_DAIC_218 and
440_utt_DAIC_219 <drops microphone> oops
440_utt_DAIC_220 and uh
440_utt_DAIC_221 this is on correctly um
440_utt_DAIC_222 hang on this ear piece is falling
440_utt_DAIC_223 there we go
440_utt_DAIC_224 that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no
440_utt_DAIC_225 i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make
440_utt_DAIC_226 in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um
440_utt_DAIC_227 the hospital should um unplug the life
440_utt_DAIC_228 or um life support machine for my father
440_utt_DAIC_229 or not
440_utt_DAIC_230 that was the hardest decision
440_utt_DAIC_231 change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
440_utt_DAIC_232 um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that
440_utt_DAIC_233 and to have been um
440_utt_DAIC_234 to resort to the situation that he was in
440_utt_DAIC_235 not capable of doing anything at all either speaking
440_utt_DAIC_236 for himself um
440_utt_DAIC_237 was beyond it
440_utt_DAIC_238 who he was and i just couldn't see him
440_utt_DAIC_239 like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told
440_utt_DAIC_240 so i agreed
440_utt_DAIC_241 to um resort that

440_utt_DAIC_249 and pretty much um
440_utt_DAIC_250 mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends
440_utt_DAIC_251 uh even though i
440_utt_DAIC_252 know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about
440_utt_DAIC_253 uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time
440_utt_DAIC_254 but um
440_utt_DAIC_255 and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out

451_utt_DAIC_118 i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like
451_utt_DAIC_119 was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving
451_utt_DAIC_120 and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway
451_utt_DAIC_121 about four miles out of our way and i just
451_utt_DAIC_122 i got very angry for about

451_utt_DAIC_124 calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it
451_utt_DAIC_125 so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but
451_utt_DAIC_126 i felt kind of

451_utt_DAIC_136 like
451_utt_DAIC_137 they're not gonna use me on a job or something
451_utt_DAIC_138 that i would
451_utt_DAIC_139 take an attitude that
451_utt_DAIC_140 um
451_utt_DAIC_141 i'll find something better it's okay and
451_utt_DAIC_142 move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me
451_utt_DAIC_143 and
451_utt_DAIC_144 you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and
451_utt_DAIC_145 you know that
451_utt_DAIC_146 whole uh
451_utt_DAIC_147 thought process that really doesn't help the situation
451_utt_DAIC_148 and i do that more often
451_utt_DAIC_149 but i
451_utt_DAIC_150 since i started chanting
451_utt_DAIC_151 but it doesn't you know
451_utt_DAIC_152 i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where
451_utt_DAIC_153 i can do that
451_utt_DAIC_154 um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what
451_utt_DAIC_155 television to buy or something <laughter> but um
451_utt_DAIC_156 um
451_utt_DAIC_157 i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences
451_utt_DAIC_158 and um
451_utt_DAIC_159 um
451_utt_DAIC_160 or leaving my  comfort
451_utt_DAIC_161 zone <z> place
451_utt_DAIC_162 if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place
451_utt_DAIC_163 that would be a very difficult decision for me
451_utt_DAIC_164 and probably leaving a relationship
451_utt_DAIC_165 very hard because
451_utt_DAIC_166 you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship
451_utt_DAIC_167 so i usually
451_utt_DAIC_168 live it out til
451_utt_DAIC_169 it's for you know it's
451_utt_DAIC_170 they leave or something you know it's very hard for me
451_utt_DAIC_171 to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on
451_utt_DAIC_172 so what i usually do is i don't make the decision
451_utt_DAIC_173 and i end up suffering
451_utt_DAIC_174 but longer
451_utt_DAIC_175 so
451_utt_DAIC_176 mhm
451_utt_DAIC_177 can we move on
451_utt_DAIC_178 um
451_utt_DAIC_179 well
451_utt_DAIC_180 uh it's hard
451_utt_DAIC_181 because um i don't know if it's because i have pain
451_utt_DAIC_182 in my back
451_utt_DAIC_183 and neck
451_utt_DAIC_184 but
451_utt_DAIC_185 i i it's difficult for me to
451_utt_DAIC_186 stay asleep i'd i i
451_utt_DAIC_187 i don't get a um
451_utt_DAIC_188 a deep sleep
451_utt_DAIC_189 um
451_utt_DAIC_190 but
451_utt_DAIC_191 at because of
451_utt_DAIC_192 uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil
451_utt_DAIC_193 and that's been putting me to sleep so
451_utt_DAIC_194 i have been um
451_utt_DAIC_195 sleeping better because of it
451_utt_DAIC_196 but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell
451_utt_DAIC_197 but before that all happened
451_utt_DAIC_198 i was um
451_utt_DAIC_199 finding it difficult to stay asleep
451_utt_DAIC_200 and so therefore i'm tired during the day and
451_utt_DAIC_201 uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable
451_utt_DAIC_202 but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or
451_utt_DAIC_203 emotional things or or or or not
451_utt_DAIC_204 i'm sorry could you repeat that
451_utt_DAIC_205 have i studied changes in my behavior
451_utt_DAIC_206 uh no <laughter>
451_utt_DAIC_207 i was not
451_utt_DAIC_208 no
451_utt_DAIC_209 mm mm
451_utt_DAIC_210 oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know
451_utt_DAIC_211 well i uh
451_utt_DAIC_212 was going to um
451_utt_DAIC_213 vegas to
451_utt_DAIC_214 meet my family was my
451_utt_DAIC_215 my family was flying in from cleveland to
451_utt_DAIC_216 uh there we have a
451_utt_DAIC_217 a relative in uh vegas
451_utt_DAIC_218 and i drove with my friend
451_utt_DAIC_219 and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday
451_utt_DAIC_220 so
451_utt_DAIC_221 we all went and
451_utt_DAIC_222 had a good time in vegas
451_utt_DAIC_223 i mean i was struggling through my cold but
451_utt_DAIC_224 but it was fun it was nice
451_utt_DAIC_225 well <laughter>
451_utt_DAIC_226 uh they think i'm funny um
451_utt_DAIC_227 they feel that i say it like it is
451_utt_DAIC_228 um
451_utt_DAIC_229 they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so
451_utt_DAIC_230 people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me
451_utt_DAIC_231 'cause i'll
451_utt_DAIC_232 i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic
451_utt_DAIC_233 but just <ju> that's just the way i talk
451_utt_DAIC_234 so
451_utt_DAIC_235 um my um
451_utt_DAIC_236 the
451_utt_DAIC_237 anger that sometimes wells up in me
451_utt_DAIC_238 you know i just
451_utt_DAIC_239 but although that that really made me i think
451_utt_DAIC_240 a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your
451_utt_DAIC_241 experiences make you who you are
451_utt_DAIC_242 and how you handle them
451_utt_DAIC_243 makes you who you are and if you don't have those
451_utt_DAIC_244 lows you don't really know what highs are
451_utt_DAIC_245 so i don't
451_utt_DAIC_246 i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever
451_utt_DAIC_247 but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today
451_utt_DAIC_248 and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these
451_utt_DAIC_249 moments where i've
451_utt_DAIC_250 just blurt out you know anger or something
451_utt_DAIC_251 i just wish that would happen more less
451_utt_DAIC_252 that the anger parts would happen less
451_utt_DAIC_253 and they are so
451_utt_DAIC_254 i guess it will <laughter>
451_utt_DAIC_255 happen less
451_utt_DAIC_256 um
451_utt_DAIC_257 don't give up hope live in the moment
451_utt_DAIC_258 and um
451_utt_DAIC_259 everything will everything will work out everything will work out
451_utt_DAIC_260 and if you believe that
451_utt_DAIC_261 then you really have nothing to fear
451_utt_DAIC_262 um
451_utt_DAIC_263 the fact that now
451_utt_DAIC_264 and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been
451_utt_DAIC_265 cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become
451_utt_DAIC_266 more um
451_utt_DAIC_267 compassionate person
451_utt_DAIC_268 and i'm able to um
451_utt_DAIC_269 uh
451_utt_DAIC_270 <ss> understand people better
451_utt_DAIC_271 and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too
451_utt_DAIC_272 and
451_utt_DAIC_273 that
451_utt_DAIC_274 if you if you treat people
451_utt_DAIC_275 from that respect that they're
451_utt_DAIC_276 they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because
451_utt_DAIC_277 you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally
451_utt_DAIC_278 and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate
451_utt_DAIC_279 you're you're happy and your life is happy
451_utt_DAIC_280 okay

458_utt_DAIC_7 we have it all
458_utt_DAIC_8 um some things i don't like about l_a um
458_utt_DAIC_9 the rent is way way way way too expensive it's ridiculous
458_utt_DAIC_10 um i have i'm well-traveled
458_utt_DAIC_11 um i enjoy seeing new places going new places um it's different everywhere the people are different
458_utt_DAIC_12 um it's fun
458_utt_DAIC_13 um okay well the most recent is last year i went to family reunion in new orleans so that was in june
458_utt_DAIC_14 and um while i was there we also visited slidell louisiana for the um
458_utt_DAIC_15 the swamp tours
458_utt_DAIC_16 and vicksburg mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in ferriday lousiana with my aunt who will be a hundred and one
458_utt_DAIC_17 this year in may
458_utt_DAIC_18 um there's a lot um
458_utt_DAIC_19 as far as traveling or just period
458_utt_DAIC_20 uh most memorable experience um well i don't know if it's just one
458_utt_DAIC_21 um probably when
458_utt_DAIC_22 i used to travel with my dad that's where i got a lot of my traveling from
458_utt_DAIC_23 um yeah it was bus car sometimes planes uh mostly what just i guess i'll say mostly down south but it was
458_utt_DAIC_24 really fun
458_utt_DAIC_25 especially the road trips
458_utt_DAIC_26 mhm
458_utt_DAIC_27 um just general and also drama
458_utt_DAIC_28 uh well my dream job is
458_utt_DAIC_29 to become a real estate investor
458_utt_DAIC_30 um well i've sort of really been into it ever since two thousand five um i just don't have the capital right now or the connections that um
458_utt_DAIC_31 since i do like real estate i'm just going to start off as a real estate agent
458_utt_DAIC_32 so i should have my license um sometime this year
458_utt_DAIC_33 outgoing
458_utt_DAIC_34 um well i'm not shy um it could be a little bit of both but um i'm pretty outgoing
458_utt_DAIC_35 um well speaking of hawaii i did uh live there for a year and a half but what do i do to relax is either um usually take a nap <laughter>
458_utt_DAIC_36 um take a bath
458_utt_DAIC_37 um or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways
458_utt_DAIC_38 um it needs to be worked on but um
458_utt_DAIC_39 i know when to control it
458_utt_DAIC_40 um when i need to
458_utt_DAIC_41 um
458_utt_DAIC_42 well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments um it was just over a text message but
458_utt_DAIC_43 um actually it was my fault but um usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but
458_utt_DAIC_44 um that's usually how it goes <laughter>
458_utt_DAIC_45 um
458_utt_DAIC_46 well
458_utt_DAIC_47 i xxx don't know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once i moved into another house it would be over but i see that we're still getting into it
458_utt_DAIC_48 so um i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess
458_utt_DAIC_49 um
458_utt_DAIC_50 probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but um
458_utt_DAIC_51 situation i wish i would've handled differently um just
458_utt_DAIC_52 kind of everything in my life almost <laughter> i could've done it differently or i would if i had the chance but i'm not worried about it 'cause i don't regret anything that i've done in my life
458_utt_DAIC_53 the hardest decision um probably when i had to get a divorce that
458_utt_DAIC_54 mm that may have been the hardest or one of the hardest decisions
458_utt_DAIC_55 um it was just a lot of um
458_utt_DAIC_56 a lot of stuff through the years um <clears throat> the relationship had kind of deteriorated um
458_utt_DAIC_57 if the relationship
458_utt_DAIC_58 between us was still good
458_utt_DAIC_59 then the things that he were doing um
458_utt_DAIC_60 i would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because um i've i would feel like well our relationship is good and
458_utt_DAIC_61 it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and
458_utt_DAIC_62 problems financial problems and he's doing this so um
458_utt_DAIC_63 i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but
458_utt_DAIC_64 eh you know he didn't wanna cooperate so
458_utt_DAIC_65 um
458_utt_DAIC_66 well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes
458_utt_DAIC_67 um
458_utt_DAIC_68 something i can erase um
458_utt_DAIC_69 mm i don't think i really need to erase anything um
458_utt_DAIC_70 i've finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i can't think of anything to erase
458_utt_DAIC_71 um it's fair slash good um there's no problems right now so i guess i'll just say good yeah there's no problems
458_utt_DAIC_72 um well i would have to say my mother
458_utt_DAIC_73 yes
458_utt_DAIC_74 um well she's just always supported me and
458_utt_DAIC_75 everything that i've done um whether it's
458_utt_DAIC_76 good or not so good so um i think that's a blessing
458_utt_DAIC_77 mhm
458_utt_DAIC_78 um sometimes sometime it's not
458_utt_DAIC_79 um well i just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is as i would like to um sometimes
458_utt_DAIC_80 so um that's more the problem i would like to get
458_utt_DAIC_81 mhm
458_utt_DAIC_82 um just sleepy <sigh> yeah sleepy tired feeling like i wanna go take a nap
458_utt_DAIC_83 um i've been feeling fine
458_utt_DAIC_84 mhm
458_utt_DAIC_85 uh no they've been about the same
458_utt_DAIC_86 no
458_utt_DAIC_87 no
458_utt_DAIC_88 um really happy uh probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so <laughter>
458_utt_DAIC_89 um well i guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe my um entertainment friend that i've been knowing since ninety six
458_utt_DAIC_90 i really wouldn't
458_utt_DAIC_91 i'm not gonna say i don't consider him a best friend but we don't really hang out that much but he is very um generous to me and my mom
458_utt_DAIC_92 mhm
458_utt_DAIC_93 so
458_utt_DAIC_94 um
458_utt_DAIC_95 well right now i spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in
458_utt_DAIC_96 but maybe after the classwork is out of the way um <laughter> maybe i can do something else
458_utt_DAIC_97 uh myself well i do wish that um
458_utt_DAIC_98 at times i could control my temper a little more and um of course i would like to lose weight
458_utt_DAIC_99 um be a little bit more active and um i wish my skin would clear up
458_utt_DAIC_100 um it was probably when i was in school um school years are terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals
458_utt_DAIC_101 so um they try to make you feel like um you're nothing like you're
458_utt_DAIC_102 piece of dirt under their foot so that's probably the last time as an adult no
458_utt_DAIC_103 um i would say that i'm genuine um i'm honest um i'm supportive
458_utt_DAIC_104 and um i'm just a good friend
458_utt_DAIC_105 no
458_utt_DAIC_106 um well uh twenty years ago um
458_utt_DAIC_107 just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like um people tell you
458_utt_DAIC_108 <laughter> um that's the main thing um i'm going to tell my daughters no
458_utt_DAIC_109 um just eat as you normally eat but eat more healthier um there's no need to gain eighty pounds when
458_utt_DAIC_110 the baby is just twenty pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose
458_utt_DAIC_111 um also if i came into any money now twenty years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or um
458_utt_DAIC_112 just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff whereas now i would um invest it
458_utt_DAIC_113 um so yeah i think that's about it <laughter>
458_utt_DAIC_114 um proud of uh <sigh>
458_utt_DAIC_115 mm i guess maybe myself um
458_utt_DAIC_116 my kids
458_utt_DAIC_117 k thank you

477_utt_DAIC_23 mhm (mhm)
477_utt_DAIC_24 why_LA (why did you move to l_a)
477_utt_DAIC_25 um
477_utt_DAIC_26 you know that's a good question i um
477_utt_DAIC_27 i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and
477_utt_DAIC_28 i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come
477_utt_DAIC_29 happy_didthat (are you happy you did that)
477_utt_DAIC_30 very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made
477_utt_DAIC_31 good_hear (that's so good to hear)
477_utt_DAIC_32 <laughter>
477_utt_DAIC_33 adapted_LA (how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a)
477_utt_DAIC_34 pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural
477_utt_DAIC_35 it seemed like a good fit
477_utt_DAIC_36 um i just really like it here
477_utt_DAIC_37 living_situation (how do you like your living situation)
477_utt_DAIC_38 oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach
477_utt_DAIC_39 um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or
477_utt_DAIC_40 um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice
477_utt_DAIC_41 awesome (awesome)
477_utt_DAIC_42 study (what did you study at school)
477_utt_DAIC_43 mm
477_utt_DAIC_44 i studied philosophy and um political theory and government
477_utt_DAIC_45 and did a little bit of english literature on the side
477_utt_DAIC_46 hard_decision (how did you decide to do that)
477_utt_DAIC_47 um it
477_utt_DAIC_48 kind of just happened naturally i think uh
477_utt_DAIC_49 i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different
477_utt_DAIC_50 areas and
477_utt_DAIC_51 i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that
477_utt_DAIC_52 still_working_on_X (are you still working in that)
477_utt_DAIC_53 um
477_utt_DAIC_54 not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities
477_utt_DAIC_55 mhm (mhm)
477_utt_DAIC_56 um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often
477_utt_DAIC_57 dream_job (what's your dream job)
477_utt_DAIC_58 <laughter> um
477_utt_DAIC_59 you know i have actually studied to become a success coach
477_utt_DAIC_60 um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice
477_utt_DAIC_61 aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students
477_utt_DAIC_62 um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams
477_utt_DAIC_63 difficult (how hard is that)
477_utt_DAIC_64 um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that
477_utt_DAIC_65 um
477_utt_DAIC_66 you know it can be challenging for people to actually
477_utt_DAIC_67 be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um
477_utt_DAIC_68 undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it
477_utt_DAIC_69 uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too
477_utt_DAIC_70 yeah_downer (yeah)
477_utt_DAIC_71 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
477_utt_DAIC_72 um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so
477_utt_DAIC_73 why2 (why)
477_utt_DAIC_74 um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people
477_utt_DAIC_75 i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged
477_utt_DAIC_76 and i think that um is
477_utt_DAIC_77 something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted
477_utt_DAIC_78 um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers
477_utt_DAIC_79 okay_confirm (okay)
477_utt_DAIC_80 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
477_utt_DAIC_81 <laughter> pretty good i think
477_utt_DAIC_82 um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time
477_utt_DAIC_83 landed_trouble (has that gotten you in trouble)
477_utt_DAIC_84 not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no
477_utt_DAIC_85 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
477_utt_DAIC_86 hmm
477_utt_DAIC_87 hmm
477_utt_DAIC_88 i'm not sure
477_utt_DAIC_89 it would've probably been a discussion over politics
477_utt_DAIC_90 and it probably would've been a friendly argument
477_utt_DAIC_91 um
477_utt_DAIC_92 probably with one of my liberal friends so
477_utt_DAIC_93 but i actually can't remember the specific time
477_utt_DAIC_94 mm (mm)
477_utt_DAIC_95 okay_confirm (okay)

477_utt_DAIC_102 do that almost every day
477_utt_DAIC_103 um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful
477_utt_DAIC_104 um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts

477_utt_DAIC_121 well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly
477_utt_DAIC_122 um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but
477_utt_DAIC_123 um i do have it sometimes
477_utt_DAIC_124 probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it
477_utt_DAIC_125 you know if i didn't have it
477_utt_DAIC_126 um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um
477_utt_DAIC_127 it's usually me in school somewhere
477_utt_DAIC_128 at the end of the semester
477_utt_DAIC_129 haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail
477_utt_DAIC_130 and
477_utt_DAIC_131 you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i
477_utt_DAIC_132 study and attend class the way i should have
477_utt_DAIC_133 um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating
477_utt_DAIC_134 and i'm not exactly sure
477_utt_DAIC_135 why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so
477_utt_DAIC_136 mhm (mhm)
477_utt_DAIC_137 trigger (are they triggered by something)
477_utt_DAIC_138 no i don't think so

477_utt_DAIC_145 and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um
477_utt_DAIC_146 i when i used to live there when he was younger
477_utt_DAIC_147 um spent a lot of time with them and
477_utt_DAIC_148 since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so
477_utt_DAIC_149 for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back
477_utt_DAIC_150 in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them
477_utt_DAIC_151 um and that i felt bad about because
477_utt_DAIC_152 we really enjoy each other's company and he
477_utt_DAIC_153 um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back
477_utt_DAIC_154 so that's um
477_utt_DAIC_155 that makes me feel bad sometimes

477_utt_DAIC_180 when i came out to california
477_utt_DAIC_181 um
477_utt_DAIC_182 i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um
477_utt_DAIC_183 it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so
477_utt_DAIC_184 um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and
477_utt_DAIC_185 um we just established this really strong friendship and
477_utt_DAIC_186 she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um
477_utt_DAIC_187 but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um
477_utt_DAIC_188 and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know
477_utt_DAIC_189 i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice

477_utt_DAIC_191 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)

477_utt_DAIC_193 sometimes my you know
477_utt_DAIC_194 depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but
477_utt_DAIC_195 um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful
477_utt_DAIC_196 um and i can sleep
477_utt_DAIC_197 uh
477_utt_DAIC_198 you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles
477_utt_DAIC_199 so
477_utt_DAIC_200 um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination
477_utt_DAIC_201 um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night
477_utt_DAIC_202 or at least if i do i don't remember it
477_utt_DAIC_203 so
477_utt_DAIC_204 uh_huh (uh huh)

477_utt_DAIC_207 because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home
477_utt_DAIC_208 most of the time but then i travel
477_utt_DAIC_209 like one week a month
477_utt_DAIC_210 and when i travel i'll take the red-eye
477_utt_DAIC_211 um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i
477_utt_DAIC_212 um sleep
477_utt_DAIC_213 poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep
477_utt_DAIC_214 and the first day
477_utt_DAIC_215 after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay
477_utt_DAIC_216 but usually the second day is not very good
477_utt_DAIC_217 um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate
477_utt_DAIC_218 and um
477_utt_DAIC_219 i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle
477_utt_DAIC_220 okay_confirm (okay)
477_utt_DAIC_221 feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)

477_utt_DAIC_230 and i hike with friends and
477_utt_DAIC_231 um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated
477_utt_DAIC_232 um because i didn't really exercise when i was there
477_utt_DAIC_233 and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like
477_utt_DAIC_234 im_sorry (i'm sorry)
477_utt_DAIC_235 it's okay

477_utt_DAIC_252 but that i can be serious
477_utt_DAIC_253 and um
477_utt_DAIC_254 that i you know care about others
477_utt_DAIC_255 uh
477_utt_DAIC_256 and that i'm loyal
477_utt_DAIC_257 and
477_utt_DAIC_258 i'm not sure what else
477_utt_DAIC_259 um
477_utt_DAIC_260 i think those those are probably the main things
477_utt_DAIC_261 okay_confirm (okay)

477_utt_DAIC_264 um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so
477_utt_DAIC_265 um
477_utt_DAIC_266 i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem
477_utt_DAIC_267 uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar
477_utt_DAIC_268 i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging
477_utt_DAIC_269 um and i wish that i um
477_utt_DAIC_270 xxx
477_utt_DAIC_271 i don't know
477_utt_DAIC_272 uh
477_utt_DAIC_273 i think i wish that i was in a relationship
477_utt_DAIC_274 so
477_utt_DAIC_275 probably those things
477_utt_DAIC_276 okay_confirm (okay)
477_utt_DAIC_277 feelbadly (tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself)
477_utt_DAIC_278 mm
477_utt_DAIC_279 hmm
477_utt_DAIC_280 so at the last organization i used to work at
477_utt_DAIC_281 i had a boss and she was
477_utt_DAIC_282 i don't feel like she was um
477_utt_DAIC_283 i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh
477_utt_DAIC_284 used to push my buttons or so i thought
477_utt_DAIC_285 and so um
477_utt_DAIC_286 one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer
477_utt_DAIC_287 um and he was upset about something and
477_utt_DAIC_288 it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was
477_utt_DAIC_289 um
477_utt_DAIC_290 but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i
477_utt_DAIC_291 have very strong opinions about how you handle
477_utt_DAIC_292 challenges with people <peo> with staff members
477_utt_DAIC_293 yeah2 (yeah)
477_utt_DAIC_294 and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought
477_utt_DAIC_295 um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel
477_utt_DAIC_296 um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it
477_utt_DAIC_297 and um
477_utt_DAIC_298 i did you know
477_utt_DAIC_299 i tried to be very calm and
477_utt_DAIC_300 said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but
477_utt_DAIC_301 uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there
477_utt_DAIC_302 to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me
477_utt_DAIC_303 or after we had that interaction so
477_utt_DAIC_304 yeah_downer (yeah)
477_utt_DAIC_305 isee_downer (i see)
477_utt_DAIC_306 advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
477_utt_DAIC_307 <laughter>
477_utt_DAIC_308 so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this
477_utt_DAIC_309 thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had
477_utt_DAIC_310 read it back then
477_utt_DAIC_311 which is
477_utt_DAIC_312 um when you think about buying something instead of thinking
477_utt_DAIC_313 uh oh
477_utt_DAIC_314 here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it
477_utt_DAIC_315 it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that
477_utt_DAIC_316 because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it
477_utt_DAIC_317 you know
477_utt_DAIC_318 intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so
477_utt_DAIC_319 you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh
477_utt_DAIC_320 been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago
477_utt_DAIC_321 hmmB (hmm)
477_utt_DAIC_322 Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)
477_utt_DAIC_323 <sigh> probably

482_utt_DAIC_66 hard_decision (how did you decide to do that)
482_utt_DAIC_67 um
482_utt_DAIC_68 it was
482_utt_DAIC_69 i guess
482_utt_DAIC_70 just uh kinda circumstances
482_utt_DAIC_71 i needed
482_utt_DAIC_72 the
482_utt_DAIC_73 the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family
482_utt_DAIC_74 and
482_utt_DAIC_75 i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain
482_utt_DAIC_76 happy_didthat (are you happy you did that)
482_utt_DAIC_77 mm
482_utt_DAIC_78 uh it's given me a lot of opportunity

482_utt_DAIC_80 dream_job (what's your dream job)
482_utt_DAIC_81 well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary
482_utt_DAIC_82 uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall

482_utt_DAIC_86 um and that was like theology and bible training
482_utt_DAIC_87 change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
482_utt_DAIC_88 um
482_utt_DAIC_89 basically god put
482_utt_DAIC_90 a um
482_utt_DAIC_91 a desire in my heart to get beyond
482_utt_DAIC_92 get beyond myself and and do something for other people
482_utt_DAIC_93 to to go and
482_utt_DAIC_94 and learn about another people their culture

482_utt_DAIC_98 well in my immediate family
482_utt_DAIC_99 um
482_utt_DAIC_100 i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters
482_utt_DAIC_101 and then um
482_utt_DAIC_102 but i i have one older brother
482_utt_DAIC_103 uh no sisters

482_utt_DAIC_106 family_roleB (how close are you to your family)
482_utt_DAIC_107 um
482_utt_DAIC_108 i'm really close with my wife and my daughters
482_utt_DAIC_109 uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped
482_utt_DAIC_110 um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old
482_utt_DAIC_111 even though he's he's five years older than me
482_utt_DAIC_112 so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him
482_utt_DAIC_113 but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents
482_utt_DAIC_114 isee_downer (i see)
482_utt_DAIC_115 influence_positive (who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life)
482_utt_DAIC_116 um
482_utt_DAIC_117 i'd say my
482_utt_DAIC_118 my youth pastor in high school
482_utt_DAIC_119 he was a real real positive influence in me
482_utt_DAIC_120 tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
482_utt_DAIC_121 um
482_utt_DAIC_122 just he has a
482_utt_DAIC_123 he has a drive and a zeal for
482_utt_DAIC_124 for pursuing the truth
482_utt_DAIC_125 um
482_utt_DAIC_126 and just uh
482_utt_DAIC_127 studying the bible and
482_utt_DAIC_128 and because of his influence that kinda
482_utt_DAIC_129 put me on a path to wanting to study the bible
482_utt_DAIC_130 okay_confirm (okay)
482_utt_DAIC_131 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
482_utt_DAIC_132 um i think i've gotten better at it
482_utt_DAIC_133 there have been
482_utt_DAIC_134 times when
482_utt_DAIC_135 you know i'll i'll get angry
482_utt_DAIC_136 and uh
482_utt_DAIC_137 you know it can just
482_utt_DAIC_138 kinda really rule over me just the frustration
482_utt_DAIC_139 and i'm the type of person that it takes me
482_utt_DAIC_140 um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to
482_utt_DAIC_141 to calm down again
482_utt_DAIC_142 but i've
482_utt_DAIC_143 i've learned um
482_utt_DAIC_144 over time that really getting angry
482_utt_DAIC_145 um and keeping that anger in doesn't
482_utt_DAIC_146 it doesn't
482_utt_DAIC_147 attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me
482_utt_DAIC_148 and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to
482_utt_DAIC_149 right2 (right)
482_utt_DAIC_150 to keep so
482_utt_DAIC_151 when <whe> when things anger me i try to
482_utt_DAIC_152 uh
482_utt_DAIC_153 like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it
482_utt_DAIC_154 and and resolve it and come to a resolution
482_utt_DAIC_155 um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem
482_utt_DAIC_156 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
482_utt_DAIC_157 um <sigh>
482_utt_DAIC_158 well a
482_utt_DAIC_159 a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago
482_utt_DAIC_160 um
482_utt_DAIC_161 my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents
482_utt_DAIC_162 and her parents had already left
482_utt_DAIC_163 um eh we were just driving down to
482_utt_DAIC_164 orange country area for this trip
482_utt_DAIC_165 and
482_utt_DAIC_166 my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed
482_utt_DAIC_167 and
482_utt_DAIC_168 but hadn't really
482_utt_DAIC_169 in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had
482_utt_DAIC_170 and so
482_utt_DAIC_171 when i was trying to meet those expectations
482_utt_DAIC_172 she
482_utt_DAIC_173 um
482_utt_DAIC_174 you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted
482_utt_DAIC_175 um and kinda getting attacked for it
482_utt_DAIC_176 so
482_utt_DAIC_177 so then i i i started yelling at her
482_utt_DAIC_178 and
482_utt_DAIC_179 yeah2 (yeah)
482_utt_DAIC_180 and we you know we had that conflict but then
482_utt_DAIC_181 you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through
482_utt_DAIC_182 and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was
482_utt_DAIC_183 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
482_utt_DAIC_184 um
482_utt_DAIC_185 are you asking the moment of during the conflict
482_utt_DAIC_186 yeah3 (yeah)
482_utt_DAIC_187 uh
482_utt_DAIC_188 very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it
482_utt_DAIC_189 in your body
482_utt_DAIC_190 um
482_utt_DAIC_191 part partly i
482_utt_DAIC_192 the i guess the
482_utt_DAIC_193 anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger
482_utt_DAIC_194 mm (mm)
482_utt_DAIC_195 so
482_utt_DAIC_196 i would think um
482_utt_DAIC_197 yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger
482_utt_DAIC_198 downer (okay)
482_utt_DAIC_199 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
482_utt_DAIC_200 mm hmm hmm hmm
482_utt_DAIC_201 i guess it was um
482_utt_DAIC_202 deciding to go
482_utt_DAIC_203 um to go to our training last year
482_utt_DAIC_204 um i i felt that god had put on my heart that
482_utt_DAIC_205 that this was something i was supposed to pursue
482_utt_DAIC_206 um my wife didn't feel that way
482_utt_DAIC_207 and
482_utt_DAIC_208 i
482_utt_DAIC_209 i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue
482_utt_DAIC_210 and
482_utt_DAIC_211 but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart
482_utt_DAIC_212 so
482_utt_DAIC_213 i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it
482_utt_DAIC_214 um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um
482_utt_DAIC_215 you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going
482_utt_DAIC_216 uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh
482_utt_DAIC_217 you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do
482_utt_DAIC_218 um
482_utt_DAIC_219 but then after i kinda gave that up
482_utt_DAIC_220 then
482_utt_DAIC_221 um
482_utt_DAIC_222 then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so
482_utt_DAIC_223 um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me
482_utt_DAIC_224 yeah_downer (yeah)

482_utt_DAIC_233 um that i would wanna erase but i i think
482_utt_DAIC_234 you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda
482_utt_DAIC_235 shape who we are
482_utt_DAIC_236 and
482_utt_DAIC_237 so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase

483_utt_DAIC_216 and to answer your question
483_utt_DAIC_217 i think thinking about it
483_utt_DAIC_218 the hardest decision i've had to make

483_utt_DAIC_236 they say you're supposed to give forgive people
483_utt_DAIC_237 for making mistakes or doing things

483_utt_DAIC_239 no matter how hard you try
483_utt_DAIC_240 and i think there are some things that once done
483_utt_DAIC_241 that that can't be
483_utt_DAIC_242 undone they just they're they're the way that they are
483_utt_DAIC_243 and i think

483_utt_DAIC_246 eh
483_utt_DAIC_247 things just fell apart after that it just it it we

483_utt_DAIC_398 wild_laughter3 ((laughter))

483_utt_DAIC_411 i just
483_utt_DAIC_412 i i don't know
483_utt_DAIC_413 i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive

483_utt_DAIC_436 don't trust her she can't be trusted
483_utt_DAIC_437 um and more importantly
483_utt_DAIC_438 don't
483_utt_DAIC_439 <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that
483_utt_DAIC_440 mm (mm)
483_utt_DAIC_441 and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally
483_utt_DAIC_442 um
483_utt_DAIC_443 yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain

484_utt_DAIC_23 travel_changed (what do you enjoy about traveling)
484_utt_DAIC_24 um <sigh>
484_utt_DAIC_25 being able to experience a different way of living
484_utt_DAIC_26 um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and
484_utt_DAIC_27 getting a different perspective
484_utt_DAIC_28 uh_huh (uh huh)
484_utt_DAIC_29 travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips)
484_utt_DAIC_30 um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months
484_utt_DAIC_31 and i was in bahia which is in the north and um
484_utt_DAIC_32 let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family
484_utt_DAIC_33 nice (nice)
484_utt_DAIC_34 change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
484_utt_DAIC_35 um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um
484_utt_DAIC_36 they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting
484_utt_DAIC_37 mhm (mhm)
484_utt_DAIC_38 memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences)
484_utt_DAIC_39 um
484_utt_DAIC_40 i think taking a bus by myself to

484_utt_DAIC_51 and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel
484_utt_DAIC_52 um
484_utt_DAIC_53 basically that those would be the main characteristics
484_utt_DAIC_54 okay_confirm (okay)
484_utt_DAIC_55 shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
484_utt_DAIC_56 i think that's a false dichotomy
484_utt_DAIC_57 but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone
484_utt_DAIC_58 and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful
484_utt_DAIC_59 makes_sense (that makes sense)
484_utt_DAIC_60 relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
484_utt_DAIC_61 <laughter>
484_utt_DAIC_62 um i listen to music
484_utt_DAIC_63 and just lay on my bed and
484_utt_DAIC_64 um
484_utt_DAIC_65 i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things
484_utt_DAIC_66 mhm (mhm)
484_utt_DAIC_67 also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise
484_utt_DAIC_68 cool3 (cool)
484_utt_DAIC_69 control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
484_utt_DAIC_70 pretty good i don't get angry a lot
484_utt_DAIC_71 um
484_utt_DAIC_72 so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that
484_utt_DAIC_73 thats_good (that's good)
484_utt_DAIC_74 last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
484_utt_DAIC_75 hmm
484_utt_DAIC_76 um
484_utt_DAIC_77 mm what month is this may
484_utt_DAIC_78 probably two months ago
484_utt_DAIC_79 and i argued
484_utt_DAIC_80 via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but
484_utt_DAIC_81 i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor
484_utt_DAIC_82 um
484_utt_DAIC_83 with a friend i've had for a few years
484_utt_DAIC_84 hmm_downer (hmm)
484_utt_DAIC_85 describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
484_utt_DAIC_86 i felt anxious
484_utt_DAIC_87 um
484_utt_DAIC_88 sad and angry
484_utt_DAIC_89 um
484_utt_DAIC_90 yeah those are the main emotions
484_utt_DAIC_91 downer (okay)
484_utt_DAIC_92 how_know (how do you know them)
484_utt_DAIC_93 i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them
484_utt_DAIC_94 and then i'll notice the physical
484_utt_DAIC_95 uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty
484_utt_DAIC_96 if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me
484_utt_DAIC_97 mhm (mhm)
484_utt_DAIC_98 situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
484_utt_DAIC_99 hmm <laughter>
484_utt_DAIC_100 that i wish i had handled differently
484_utt_DAIC_101 i guess related to this argument um
484_utt_DAIC_102 i went out one night and got
484_utt_DAIC_103 a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up
484_utt_DAIC_104 calling a person for a ride
484_utt_DAIC_105 home but that
484_utt_DAIC_106 really upset that person
484_utt_DAIC_107 and i know that
484_utt_DAIC_108 it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um
484_utt_DAIC_109 it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did
484_utt_DAIC_110 okay_confirm (okay)
484_utt_DAIC_111 hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
484_utt_DAIC_112 mm
484_utt_DAIC_113 <clears throat>
484_utt_DAIC_114 hardest decision <sigh>
484_utt_DAIC_115 wow um
484_utt_DAIC_116 probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards
484_utt_DAIC_117 well after dropping out i had to really
484_utt_DAIC_118 rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to
484_utt_DAIC_119 dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on
484_utt_DAIC_120 yeah_downer (yeah)
484_utt_DAIC_121 hard_decision (how did you decide to do that)
484_utt_DAIC_122 um <sigh>
484_utt_DAIC_123 i think by recognizing what i don't want to do
484_utt_DAIC_124 and doing a lot of research on
484_utt_DAIC_125 program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program
484_utt_DAIC_126 makes_sense (that makes sense)
484_utt_DAIC_127 memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
484_utt_DAIC_128 <sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh>
484_utt_DAIC_129 oh <laughter>
484_utt_DAIC_130 um
484_utt_DAIC_131 revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier
484_utt_DAIC_132 it was a dating relationship and
484_utt_DAIC_133 a few years ago we had a falling out
484_utt_DAIC_134 over his treatment of me
484_utt_DAIC_135 and it involved
484_utt_DAIC_136 another person and i wish i could
484_utt_DAIC_137 get that out of my mind
484_utt_DAIC_138 sorry_hear (i'm sorry to hear that)
484_utt_DAIC_139 family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
484_utt_DAIC_140 um <laughter>

484_utt_DAIC_142 i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten
484_utt_DAIC_143 um closer to her as an adult
484_utt_DAIC_144 uh we talk pretty regularly
484_utt_DAIC_145 with my dad i grew up with him
484_utt_DAIC_146 mostly he lives in atlanta and
484_utt_DAIC_147 um we don't talk as much but
484_utt_DAIC_148 we are
484_utt_DAIC_149 we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that
484_utt_DAIC_150 contentious or anything
484_utt_DAIC_151 and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family
484_utt_DAIC_152 uh_huh (uh huh)
484_utt_DAIC_153 um so
484_utt_DAIC_154 in general i'm not really that close to family
484_utt_DAIC_155 influence_positive (who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life)
484_utt_DAIC_156 um
484_utt_DAIC_157 one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five
484_utt_DAIC_158 and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really
484_utt_DAIC_159 opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things
484_utt_DAIC_160 thats_great (that's great)
484_utt_DAIC_161 easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)

484_utt_DAIC_164 because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day
484_utt_DAIC_165 and the thought of it is

484_utt_DAIC_169 <clears throat>
484_utt_DAIC_170 symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
484_utt_DAIC_171 i think just <sigh>
484_utt_DAIC_172 self-talk about how what i have to do
484_utt_DAIC_173 isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year
484_utt_DAIC_174 um
484_utt_DAIC_175 trying to think of things that
484_utt_DAIC_176 i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music
484_utt_DAIC_177 and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going
484_utt_DAIC_178 mhm (mhm)

484_utt_DAIC_180 <sigh> feeling <sigh>
484_utt_DAIC_181 uh wow um
484_utt_DAIC_182 feeling
484_utt_DAIC_183 emotionally drained on some ways and
484_utt_DAIC_184 at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown
484_utt_DAIC_185 so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of
484_utt_DAIC_186 feeling accomplished and proud at the same time
484_utt_DAIC_187 uh_huh (uh huh)

484_utt_DAIC_196 i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous
484_utt_DAIC_197 and just all those changes going on
484_utt_DAIC_198 really um
484_utt_DAIC_199 exacerbated 
484_utt_DAIC_200 things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there
484_utt_DAIC_201 and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed
484_utt_DAIC_202 yeah_downer (yeah)
